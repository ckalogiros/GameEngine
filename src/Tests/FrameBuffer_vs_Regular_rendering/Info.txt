Use a big amount of data, to compare rendering efficiency.

Widget used: scroller with labels.
   Create 500 * 2 label widgets
   Data Ammount: See pictures

For the regular test, we just rendered the geometry from the vertex buffers.
The frequency is determined by the request animation frame, which i think it is 60 frames ~= 16 miliseconds.

On the second test, we draw all vertexbuffers to a framebuffer and then render the framebuffer as a texture to the canvas.
The frequency is 16 miliseconds, through a js setTimeInterval.
The callback reads all vertexbuffers and renders them to the framebuffer.
The vertexbuffers then are exluded from the renderqueue.
