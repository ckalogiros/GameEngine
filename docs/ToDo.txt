--------------------------------------------------- CONTINUE

Correct the meshes dimentions to not create double the width and height

Implement: An easy way of write and use custom shaders:
  1. Create a geo and mat.
  2. Implement: pass shaders to ???

Finish the event dispatchEvent

Create Camera controls 
--------------------------------------------------- CONTINUE
--------------------------------------------------- ASAP

Implement Renderer

implement uniforms
For the uniforms buffer in the shaders to be dynamic size, we must implement a 
force reload shaders and relink current program, in order to add meshes at runtime.  

implement flags (for material), 
so that we can modify gl options, different material flags for dif shader rendering, lighting etc.  

Implement a Renderer, that handles the webGl context
and a Camera class that is part of the renderer class
and can create Projection as orthographic views
--------------------------------------------------- ASAP



--------------------------------------------------- New ToDo's
Reimplement sid to be a class. 
The class will return a sid 
object:{
  attr:,
  unif:,
  fx:,
  etc ...


}
--------------------------------------------------- New ToDo's


ERASABLE
  
  br.powUp[i]   
  
  the many calls to: gl.uniform3fv( program.unifLoc.pos,   [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] );
  
  br.col, br.pos?, .....
  
  activate br.changed for all buffers
  
  function vertexWPos3( wPos, numObjects-. null )
  
--------------------------------------------------- ToDo

typed Arrays views: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays
// for transforming all kind of arrays to typed ones. ex. "brIndex = new Array"

typed Arrays methods : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array

change powUp.type from string to contant number

change all arrays [] to new32FloatArrays or uints

try to make one for loop for drawing everything in render

try to create rectangles with general call to createRect

use return in all if 's (like collisions, for unnecessary for loops)

Display realFps with call to date.now()(instead of for loop)

create unsignedInt or bool type

brake the createData function into seperate for each  type

//if( powUps[i].pos[1] < player[ plIndex ].pos[1] +1 )

make the .split for texts inside CalculateTextDimentions so it finds
all characters

Make:	bricksCollumsIndexArr	//for collisions
Make:	bricksRowsIndexArr		//for collisions
Make:	bricksPowUpsIndexArr 	//for different texturing

  Reverse all loops (ex. --i)
  All loops ++i NOT i++


  ### 2
  Make texture creating and loading robust 
    When creating the font texture we want texWidth and height in the glTexture object(for use)
    OR connect the font texture(with an array index??) with the glTexture object

!!!
In meshes that consist of an array of meshes, like balls and bricks etc,
it is best to implement an 'all active' array to hold the indexes of the
active meshes, insted of looping through all meshes and checking if(mesh.isActive)
OR having to sort the array by active meshes.

XXX
Implement the Rect class as extension to every class  that has a rect mesh

Remove all unecessary functions like: BallGetDim() etc

XXX
See if we can set all animations via Animation class
(Current Animations are implemented as folows: 
    export function RunAnimations() {

      ButtonCreateScaleAnimation();
      UiModRunAnimation();
      PowerUpRunAnimation();
      PlayerEnlargeAnimation();

    }
)

Change the vars name 'name' in TextLabel class to 'str' or 'text'

*** Implement the players xdir momentum to speed up ball
    Make PlayerOnUpdate() or correct existing OnPlayerMove() function
    to run on every frame so we can update the player's state.inMove, 


Make the BallUpdateProjectLine() to run smoother with a timer(every 16 ms)


Create some sort of timed events with a class similar to animations 
so that we initiate an event, passing 2 callbacks.
One callback is checking when the event is completed and the second callback 
is for the following event to start

Create a font that is [0,0] uv coords, if not already implemented

!!
All GetNextFree class member fuctions should not waste time
doing a search for free element from the start every time,
instead the function should have an iterator pointing to the next i-th
element each time it is called, and the iterator should return to 0-th element at the end of the array. 



!!!!
Check all fragment shaders for constant variables for all fragments.
If any, calculate them in vertex shader instead of making the calculations 
for every fragment
