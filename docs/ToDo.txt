Static draw meshes should be rendered to a render buffer once
and render buffer should been drawn every frame without 
redrawing the meshes to it's self

--------------------------------------------------- TESTING!
. Implement a smooth fps timer, by addding
  on each frame the new delta time but
  subtracting the 'oldest' one, with a constant counter.
  The 'oldest' value is up to dicision. For example
  we could set 1000 samples, so the oldest will be the -100 delta. 
--------------------------------------------------- TESTING!

--------------------------------------------------- IMIDIATE!

. Any new mesh or existing mesh update to the gfx buffers should be an One Time Event().
  ??
    DispatchEvent(update gfx pipeline), which runs for every update separately
    Or 
    gather all updates {
      IF: scene's progidx needsUpdate = true 
      IF: scene's vbidx needsUpdate = true
      IF: scene's mesh needsUpdate = true
    }
    which  runs all updates at once
    but we have to check for updates on each frame
  ??

  with the Scene being responsible to run for the 'gfx.prog[i].vb[j].mesh.Render() ' functionality. 

. Implement set render queue priority for meshes inside a vertexBuffer.

  . Implement destruction of gfx buffers and gl program.
    (Also make sure all suposed private buffers are set private).

--------------------------------------------------- _asdhjdTODO_

TODO: Render all the meshes taht do not change (vertex buffers) to a frame buffer texture and render the texture instead

// TODO: . IMPORTANT!:Batch remove meshes attribs from gfx buffers.
  Example: 
      GfxRemoveMesh(gfx){
        SOME_BUFFER[some].push(start, progidx,, vbidx)
      }
      GfxRemoveBatch(SOME_BUFFER){
        // Unify all starts of all attribs to be removed and shift exixting attributes of the buffer as few times as possible.
      }

. Batch activate/deactivate buffers. Use an indexed  by prog and vb buffer.
  Example: StoreForUpdate(arr); arr = prog[progidx].vb[vbidx]
           StoreForUpdate(arr){
              GfxSetVbShow(progs[arr[i]], progs[arr[i]].vertexBuffer[arr[i].vb[j]])
           }

. Implement second popup menu(from the main popup menu)

. Maybe we should implement timeIntervals for the GlDraw function. 
. Or have static meshes in specific programs and buffers. 

. Implement:
    Widget Menu.
    Widget Drop-Down-Menu.

. Move touch screen input from MouseEvents.js to input folder

. Create a division of canvas, for colission detection, 
  place meshes in 2D(like UI) and many more.
. Implement RenderBuffers.
. Finish a good implementation for Animations.
. Event driven system and how it can offer efficiency and/or flexibility.
. Implement glBufferSubData.
. Implement the strategy for divide meshes into static draw and dynamic draw.

. - Index Buffers - 
  . Test draw specific meshes from creating another index buffer, 
    or if possible select indices from an index buffer.
  . Maybe create groups of indices stored in meshes, that
    will allow the re-rendering of certain groups of meshes,
    also maybe we implement an index-based solution to
    address vertices and its attributes instead of gfxInfo start????  

. - More Geometry -
  . Line
  . BezierCurve
  . Triangle2D
  . Triangle3D
  . etc
