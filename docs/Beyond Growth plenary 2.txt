[Applause] [Music]
24:45
foreign
24:54
and I really would like to thank you for your kind introduction and first and foremost I really would like to thank
25:00
all of you for coming to Brussels and for making this huge hemicycle as full
25:07
as I rarely have opportunity to see and I'm so happy to see that there are so
25:13
many young people who are interested in this very important topic because it's about you it's about the future and it's
25:19
about the future of Europe and future of our planet and and very rarely uh I see
25:26
so many people in such a positive spirit but I think that today the price for uh for beaming positive energy across the
25:34
whole is indeed Philly plumbers because with him we've been discussing the
25:40
possibility to have this europe-wide conference and discussion quite some time ago and I'm so happy that we
25:47
collaborated so well as an institutions as a member states and Academia to make
25:53
sure that you can listen to different aspects of this very important issue make your own judges and I think in the
26:00
positive sense to push us to go really beyond the GDP
26:06
[Music] and and therefore I don't have to hide
26:13
that it's indeed my pleasure to be here with you at this uh conference because
26:19
uh this is not the first one and if you want to be honest we have to say that
26:25
we've been discussing this type of uh issues and the challenges already quite
26:31
some time ago if you look at our archives I can told you that the European Union had its first high-level
26:38
conference on this topic already back in 2007. and today various initiatives such as
26:46
United Nations sustainable development goals aim to revitalize a global
26:51
partnership for the sustainable development but despite the general agreement that using gross domestic
26:58
products by itself to measure the growth and progress of our society is indeed a
27:05
limited approach progress in integrating this idea into policy making has been
27:11
slow so growth GDP growth remains still because of all this our main point of
27:20
reference but what would happen if we took into account other factors like for
27:26
example environmental sustainability what the what ranking change for say
27:32
Saudi Arabia whose GDP was the 18th highest in the world in 2022 but almost half of which
27:40
was due to the oil extraction and this is the question we started
27:46
asking ourselves also in our community of strategic Force foresight experts
27:54
who've been helping me to draft the Strategic for said reports which was a novelty since the arrival of our new
28:01
president at daytime also off on the line to whom you had I'm sure the the
28:06
pleasure to listen this morning and when we've been looking at the future is it
28:12
it's really inevitable that India will surprise Europe in terms of nominal GDP
28:19
by 2050 shouldn't we have a more comprehensive look at how to measure the economic growth and therefore our first
28:27
strategic foresight report called for the shift to the new economic model
28:32
which should be supported by an integrated approach to measuring also well-being Beyond GDP
28:40
in other words the question was how can we turn sustainability and well-being
28:46
into the recipe for Europe's open strategic autonomy and opinion by our
28:52
Economic Security and trade power and I can also tell you that we are currently
28:57
working to provide some answers to these very complex questions and answers will
29:02
be presented in our strategic foresight report which you are presenting for this year and which we plan to publish before
29:11
the summer break as we look to steal Europe through the
29:16
twin green and digital transition in uncertain times the subject is more
29:21
important than ever and our Arias for action on this topic will help shape our policies today but also very clearly in
29:30
the coming years and coming decades and therefore I think we have to use our
29:35
abilities our new techniques of anticipatory governance like strategic foresight to
29:43
make sure that we would present the shared and operational vision of how we
29:49
can determine our progress as we look to build a socially and economically sustainable competitive but also
29:56
resilient future for Europe and what is very important to to say is
30:02
that we are not starting from the scratch already back in 2020 when we
30:07
started with our strategic foresight uh analysis we put forward and propose to
30:14
our policy makers and decision takers that the resilience should become a new strategic pillar for all EU policies on
30:22
par with the twin and grid and digital transition and I believe that you would
30:28
agree with me that especially Lessons Learned From covet crisis have proven us correcting that regard
30:33
also proposed in that reports a new tool which I'm sure we'll be also discussing
30:39
with the prominent panelists who kindly join me in the debate with you and these
30:46
are resilient dashboards and I'm very glad that the professors who are behind me help us with their contributions to
30:53
make sure that these resilient dashboards would not remain just the subject of academic discussions but that
31:01
they will gradually become from the concept stage into the part of our
31:09
ongoing reflection how to go beyond GDP and how to do it in a holistic manner
31:15
across the green digital socioeconomic and geopolitical dimensions
31:21
and I think what is very important for you to know that the resilient dashboards have become now an integral
31:28
part of the country reports that form part of the European semester cycle of
31:34
Economic Policy coordination which is one of our main instruments in the EU
31:39
how to look into the cooperation collaboration and steering of our
31:44
economies across the member states and then I'm sure that our president ursulf
31:50
on the lines touch upon the importance of recovery and resilience facility
31:55
which brought necessary financial support and it's clearly designed not
32:00
only to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on GDP but also to boost
32:05
Europe's resilience Theory forms and investment so we have made some progress
32:11
but it's now time as I said a few minutes earlier to take another step
32:17
forward GDP remains a useful indicator for economic outputs being closely linked to
32:24
tax revenues and gross national income but it tells us nothing about for example income distributions quality of
32:31
life quality of Health Care Quality of Education Environmental Protection or
32:37
the social cost of achieving that economic output so we have to and we are developing a
32:45
new monitoring framework to guide our efforts towards going Beyond GDP
32:51
following up on an area for Action that we have identified previously for the
32:58
first time the European commission is bringing together all the different strands of work on this complex topic
33:05
into the single framework this approach is aimed at progressively complementing
33:11
the GDP with MDK indicators for other elements that are important for the
33:17
sustainable future we are seeking to build we can consider this a new metric of
33:25
well-being which will fit into EU policy making in the coming years and decades
33:31
that means the well-being of people today including different aspects of
33:38
quality of life but it also means the well-being of people tomorrow which will
33:45
require intergenerational fairness solidarity and inclusiveness as
33:50
sustainable progress should leave no one and no place behind
33:55
additionally they must also look beyond our borders and measure sustainable and
34:01
inclusive well-being not only in the EU but also in third countries and we need
34:07
to continue contributing to The Wider discussion with the International Community especially with regards to the
34:15
work being done on this subject by the oecd and the United Nations
34:20
our 2023 strategic foresight report will provide the first results from our
34:26
internal foresight work on this very important reflection so ladies and
34:31
gentlemen dear participants the debate around going Beyond GDP must be an open
34:38
one so if you want to make a progress and we wanted to Bear
34:43
fruits and have an impact on our policy making there is a need for continued
34:49
dialogue between all those involved as it was when we've been preparing this conference EU institutions member states
34:57
civil society ngos academias and business and we need the Best Brands to
35:04
contribute so I'm happy so many of you are here because we definitely can benefit from that and therefore the
35:11
occasions and debates like we have today are so important and are so relevant this joint effort must continue as it
35:19
can help us steer a path to the sustainable resilient and fair future
35:24
that we are trying to build for future generations of Europeans and I will stop
35:29
here because as you are I'm also very much interested to the other interventions to your questions to your
35:36
comments to your statements and to the debate we will all have so once again thank you very much for the interest into the topic thank you very much for
35:43
making this Hemi cycle so full and thank you very much being so supportive and so
35:48
active on this matter thank you [Applause] [Music]
36:03
the new idea
36:10
thank you very much it's an honor to be here what is the shape of progress
36:18
what image do we have in our mind of progress the 20th century
36:23
apparently gave us a very dominant shape of progress
36:30
like this oh yeah
36:38
growth endlessly and as everybody knows exponential growth it doesn't just stop
36:43
where this host pipe stops it goes through the ceiling it was measured with one number we
36:50
called it GDP the challenge of course is that we know that economic activity is resource
36:56
intensive it uses energy it uses materials and the direction that needs to travel
37:04
is the other way because of the massive overshoot we face so goodbye to the one
37:12
piece of pipe we need to start again we need a new compass for where we
37:18
actually want to go a new shape of progress that serves these times that serves what we already know so I offer
37:25
you one the only donut that actually turns out to be good for us because you don't need to eat this one we just need to put it
37:32
into practice the goal leave no one in the hole in the middle of the donut falling short on the
37:38
essentials of life and leave no one without life's essential resources but at the same time do not overshoot that
37:45
outer limit that is where we destroy the life supporting systems of the only
37:51
known living planet in the universe meet the needs of all people
37:57
within the means of this living planet surely this is our existential shared
38:04
goal this is a new shape of progress because it's not endless growth it's thriving in balance between the social
38:12
foundation and the ecological ceiling in fact I'm going to invite you to do
38:17
this right now with your hands just do the shapes right yeah here we are right thriving in balance
38:24
and if you do it just close here it's just like a heartbeat we already know in our own bodies that
38:31
our bodies Thrive when they are healthy in Balance enough food water oxygen heat
38:38
but not too much human health lies in Balance can we take what we deeply know in our bodies and
38:46
take from Human Health to planetary health and create a living world of
38:52
which we are a part that thrives in Balance if balance is the shape of future progress we are so far from that
38:59
right now as all the red here shows billions of people in the world fall short on the essentials of life
39:05
and we are overshooting six at least six of the nine planetary boundaries
39:12
I've no doubt that all of our children's children will tug every one of us on the
39:18
sleeve one day and say did you know about this and what did you do once that you knew
39:27
how did you transform your work in business in government in education in
39:33
community activism how did you transform your lifestyle your country your company
39:39
surely this is the story to turn around and we need metrics that tell us where
39:45
to go and then policies that actually take us there from the global donut we can go to
39:51
National Donuts four very different countries Malawi human shortfall without overshooting
39:57
their share of the planet China double whammy human shortfall and ecological overshoot let's go to the us at the end
40:04
massive ecological overshoot drawing so much of earth's resources into the East
40:09
United States and Europe there the European nations certainly human shortfall and ecological
40:16
overshoot together this is the story to turn around how can this start to happen
40:22
what if every nation in Europe indeed in the world started to say this is our goal now how do we unroll this donut
40:30
let's open it up and go inside between the social foundation and the ecological
40:35
ceiling I invite everyone imagine a place you live and love and ask of it
40:41
this question how can our nation become a home to thriving people in a thriving place
40:47
while respecting the well-being of all people and the health of the whole planet
40:52
this is what the shape of progress becomes in fact we have four questions to ask
40:59
here there's local aspirations how can everybody here Thrive with food health
41:04
education housing transport respect income a life of dignity for all here
41:11
and how can local nature here Thrive how can our cities repair and restore and
41:17
regenerate the ecosystems of which we're apart beautiful local aspirations
41:23
but every city every nation is part of the world embedded through Global Supply
41:29
chains through Global policies through histories of colonialism through futures of climate and ecological impacts we are
41:36
connected to the world and must take our responsibilities for the whole so how can we
41:42
respect the health of the whole planet come back within that ecological overshoot of energy use and material
41:48
reuse reduce our impact come back within
41:54
this single living planet and how do we respect the rights of people worldwide
42:00
the people who Stitch the clothes we're wearing who picked and packed the food we've eaten who assembled the lights and
42:07
phones and cameras and screens and made the carpets and all the materials they are worldwide we haven't right a
42:13
responsibility to respect their lives too so fine ideas local aspirations and
42:21
Global responsibilities what if we actually put this into practice this is where we must now go we have the
42:28
vision now we need the action there are over 70 cities and regions and
42:34
it's begun with cities and regions not with Nations but cities districts towns and regions who've taken this very
42:39
concept and are putting it into practice in local government around the world let me show you just two
42:46
Barcelona has unrolling the donut Gathering the metrics holding itself to account this
42:53
will be the beginnings of the future tool for monitoring whether or not this
42:58
city is living within the donor what will be the policies that will
43:04
actually take them there how will they reduce their carbon and material footprint while riding housing and
43:11
education and health for all this is the 21st century challenge every city and Nation must take on
43:17
Brussels right here a 10-minute ride away I was this morning in a fantastic meeting the Brussels
43:24
Capital Region led by Barbara attract Secretary of State for economic transition
43:29
are looking at Brussels through this lens with all the monitoring indicators but
43:34
then following up with policies she was telling us we are changing the rules the regulations so the only
43:40
businesses that are beginning to respect these planetary boundaries can do business here Public Finance from 2030
43:46
will only flow to companies that actually are coming into this space public money will only fund research and
43:54
Innovation that takes us into this space let's put on Service public services that ensure the resources we have
44:01
provide first for the rights of all people the universal basic Services we need in place
44:09
the Zoe Institute have created such a compass for the whole European Union using its own dashboards of resilience
44:15
its own metrics it's time to follow through with these metrics with policies
44:21
that turn them into practice not a stability and growth pact but accompanying that with a well-being and
44:27
stability state of well-being and sustainability pact Guided by these
44:32
metrics because these are the metrics that will take us safely with security
44:37
with resilience with human rights and ecological Integrity through the 25th to
44:44
the 21st century [Applause] [Music]
44:55
to work with policy makers who are already doing this who get in touch and say we're we're in action this is where
45:01
leadership is along with the youth the policy makers who say were on it we're doing it in these cities and we've
45:08
just published a report which is showing how these 70 places are starting to put
45:13
this into practice let's make this practice everywhere let's build on the peer leadership of those who are already
45:19
in action showing that what some think is impossible is already beginning to happen
45:25
are they as far as they need to be no way no way this is a challenge to begin in a
45:31
city that's embedded in a nation embedded in a region embedded and global system that is pushing back with power
45:36
against these changes and yet we start and yet we rise so it is time to put
45:43
these ideas into practice to take all the indicators we have and follow through with policies that actually
45:50
begin to deliver this new shape of progress that is thriving thank you very
45:55
much [Applause] [Music]
46:01
[Applause] thank you
46:08
female Gates
46:16
is foreign
46:36
good afternoon everyone it's a real pleasure thank you so much for the kind introduction for inviting the oecd to be
46:43
part of this very very important conversation I think we were all very encouraged throughout the day to see how
46:49
high is the momentum at the very high level of the EU policy making uh of
46:55
course we've been partnering with many of you in the room with Europe but also you know with the Academia and I see a
47:02
lot of friends that obviously have been instrumental uh to set this in motion uh
47:08
today I just wanted to focus on three quick points because I was here during the day and I saw that the room has a
47:14
lot of questions so I really want to move to the most interactive part of the debate but I want to focus quickly on
47:20
the why the how and the what of the well-being and so when it comes
47:26
to the why again we heard many today talking about the many interconnected
47:32
challenges that all societies all countries of this world are facing today
47:37
and those those challenges come from this very unbalanced economic model and
47:43
we have a problem of course it's not just the economy of society but this is actually endangering uh the democracy
47:50
and so if we can't show the value that our shared uh Democratic societies are
47:56
in fact bringing to us then we're going to obviously create a real real breakdown of the social contract so all
48:04
the recent crises have shown this that in absence are very very immediate systemic changes we are going to have a
48:12
further increase of inequalities I think it's very clear in this charts so let me
48:18
start by telling you about the mental health conditions and this is something actually that goes well beyond the most
48:24
vulnerable in the Oil City countries one in fact above one quarter of the oecd
48:31
populations are facing today a mental health issue in other words these people actually are reporting a lot of symptoms
48:36
of anxiety and depression so this is really a sign that the society is not thriving and there are groups that are
48:44
more concerned in the sense that are more hit by these issues and this is the young 40 of the young people in this Oil
48:52
City countries for which we have done the study actually are coming up with this high level of mental distress
48:59
cost of living crisis if I tell you about inflation rate in Europe in
49:05
February was 13 and that was ranging from five percent in luxemore to 28
49:11
percent in Hungary but actually this is just the average inflation rate when you're looking at the cost of living
49:16
crisis and who is paying the price for that it's once again the most vulnerable
49:21
the low-income people are the ones that live in the river areas but also The Young and the elderly and last but not
49:29
least and again that was Set uh really many times during the day so I will be very short on this one uh six of the
49:36
planetary bound there is have already been overcome and ecological Footprints are continue to grow in many many
49:43
regions of the world so how do we address that it all starts with
49:49
measurement I think in the oecd this is what I've been doing for the last 15 years really sort of come up with
49:54
metrics and a very very strong measurement framework that could be used by many countries by many communities
50:01
and this is the well-being framework that we introduced back in 2011. this is a framework that really focuses on what
50:08
matters to people but in terms of their economic well-being and non-economic well-being so relational personal social
50:15
well-being all those aspects are actually included in the well-being framework so it's really really
50:20
important I think over the day I heard a lot of people talking about the quality of social bonds of communities the
50:26
strands of communities the strengths of social relationship the social capital so this is included here and of course
50:32
it's not just about the averages outcomes but also how those outcomes vary across the population so again it
50:38
is important with a strong focus on the ones that are indeed left behind by the
50:45
system and also somebody this morning talk about the interactions and you know the intersectionalities here because a
50:51
lot of disadvantages unfortunately accumulate so we can't just look at you know the sort of the big differences in
50:57
the system we really need to understand again how the disadvantages compound across the many life domains finally
51:04
it's not obviously about the well-being as we know it today this is about building up for the future building up
51:12
resources for the future so we need to understand what are the key capitals and this is what we're trying to do in this
51:17
framework so we're looking at for key types of capital natural Capital Social
51:23
Capital human capital and economic carbiology how they are distributed in the populations this is something that
51:28
very often is actually overlooked even by the most sophisticated statistical
51:33
systems of this world so this gives you a very very powerful tool to monitor
51:39
progress and this is something we've been applying in New York City for many many years but the most interesting piece of information I may share with
51:45
you today is the fact that today 70 of the oecd countries meaning 30 countries
51:50
the most rich countries of this world in fact every introduced their own well-being Frameworks which is really
51:55
really important because obviously we need to have strong buying and ownership by each jurisdictions but those
52:02
Frameworks are modeled uh around I would say the broad lines of the oecd frame and that is important as well because we
52:09
also need to have some national consistencies so now I want to go to the perhaps most
52:16
challenging part of this discussion uh which is the issues of what we do what
52:21
type of policies as we start this discussion and many of you are very I would say old on this but many are very
52:27
new and a lot of questions come to the table how do we actually do that so what actually Concrete Solutions we need here
52:33
so we've been kind of trying to sort of articulate this in the UC for a while and what we're trying to offer today is
52:40
the idea that we need to come with solutions that are triple ones meaning the solutions that are Goods for the uh
52:48
thriving so for making societies and economies trying to die it's good from the perspective of reducing inequalities
52:55
and is also good from a sustainability perspective so we're trying to say let's
53:00
think of the challenges so every policy makers think about the challenges you're facing
53:05
and try to devise solutions that answer to all these questions at the same time now of course sometimes it doesn't work
53:11
but actually some in other cases it does work so I want to give you some illustrations of the the policies that
53:18
we consider tribal ones first of all let me start by jobs creation we need of
53:23
course jobs it means we want obviously in this very very particular context today at the post pandemic
53:30
recovery we want to make sure this recovery is job rich but it's you know not every type of jobs we need to have
53:36
high quality jobs that means jobs with high security High stability
53:41
Equitable earnings and I think today there were people talking about living
53:47
wages minimum wages Europe have done a lot in this respect but more needs to happen but also jobs that actually come
53:54
with a lot of resources for the well-being of workers in the workplace another example another illustration
54:01
okay in the wake up of the Mental Health crisis that we have observed during epidemic is everything that governments
54:08
can't to do can do to promote and prevent Mental Health illnesses and I think one of the problem
54:16
with policy making in general is that you know we want to go with quick fix so if there is a problem we just want to
54:21
act and that is good I think on the one hand but on the other hand the problem is we take solutions that sometimes are
54:27
very narrow very short-sighted they probably wouldn't matter health is that there are so many factors actually that
54:33
are driving the mental distress that we're seeing today in our city societies and before it takes all of the
54:39
government a whole society approach we need programs really that comes in many different uh policies areas it's not
54:46
just what the healthcare sector can do for instance we need to have strong mental health inventions in schools but
54:52
we also have to put together some programs that let's say leverage
54:58
interlinkages within mental and Financial Health so for instance very special specific type of debt relief
55:04
programs for people actually that are in a very very uh sort of um in in material
55:11
hardship and material depression conditions and at the same time mentally health so there are many other important
55:18
examples of this and again so the basic message there that it needs to happen across the board I have other example
55:24
let me say very quickly about focusing on the disadvantaged children youth and their
55:31
families and I think this is obviously about investing in the human capital European tree is something that is very very important it's called the child
55:37
guarantee this is about providing the adequate level of services when it comes
55:43
to health to Social Services to education and housing this is so important and obviously that comes with
55:51
a lot of returns in the previous discussion uh you know we talk about how we Finance action really welfare
55:57
actually the best way to finance the welfare state is invest in human capital that's actually is bringing a lot of
56:04
positive returns finally how do we green the economy of course it's a massive huge transformation we have to do a lot
56:10
of things and again today we heard about sort of rethinking industrial policy from that perspective but this is also
56:16
about how we support the vulnerable households who are in fact in isolation to of energy poverty so how do we make
56:24
sure that on the on the one hand we can help them obviously facing that with transition but at the same time we're
56:31
doing it with price-based mechanisms because we also have to design intensivise the use of fossil fuels and
56:38
this is also about supporting the workers the communities and the businesses that are impacted by the
56:44
shift of economic opportunities that come along with the decarbonization and finally this is about working with the
56:51
private sector and making sure that again the businesses are given a lot of response sensibility and are made
56:57
accountable about those shifts the the final word I want to say is about you
57:03
know these are example of policies but actually here we're talking as I said the big system change and that only
57:08
comes to Big interventions in terms of governance and I think this is really what we would like to see from Europe
57:14
going forward having that leadership in term in terms of you know re-u designing
57:19
the all governance and systems I think Aurora was sharing some of the obviously Paces probably the key levers uh you
57:26
know the key governance programs in Europe but there are many more and this is about really engineering the system
57:31
having a broad overview of how the different policy interventions that
57:36
Europe is introducing but also Europe is coordinating with the rest of the world how those impact the well-being of
57:43
people thank you so much [Applause] [Music]
57:51
foreign
58:32
oh my God thank you very much
58:39
I'm really really hard not to be here and I thank you Philippe and all for this invitation
58:45
if we really want to change our goals and shift from GDP growth to Social and
58:50
ecological prosperity and sustainability we should probably first get involved in
58:57
a collective introspection on the symbolic and Social Power that
59:02
numbers have in our Collective life and in our ways to conduct public policies
59:09
the sociohistorian Alan de Rozier recalled us that the process of
59:16
quantification or production of indicators needs two steps the first one is to convene upon and
59:24
then to measure and indeed indicators are really Frameworks of representation
59:30
and of interpretation of realities they reflect as much as they Institute the
59:37
reality they make it in a way they embody the way by which public problems
59:42
are conceptualized and solutions imagines getting new indicators to go beyond
59:48
growth which is definitely not sufficient but necessary requires Upstream to agree on what ought
59:56
to be measured Downstream now why is this question being asked today
1:00:02
we were very few as Aurora mentioned earlier at the end of the 90s to insist on the fact that the major macroeconomic
1:00:09
indicators were really misleading GDP and growth inflation and employment even
1:00:14
major elements of the magical Square misleading because growth has been
1:00:20
imagined after World War II to follow a specific political project
1:00:26
track the expansion of material activity and of on the expansion of the market
1:00:32
this had been discussed by Pioneers in France in particular around the work of Dominic Meda what is health wealth in
1:00:39
1999 on the one hand and Jean gadre on the other and also by Pioneers in
1:00:46
Belgium with Isabel Cassius just to name a few they and I gathered with members
1:00:52
of the Civil Society in the forum for other indicators of wealth with the idea
1:00:58
of stimulating reflection in France and then later to influence the work of the
1:01:04
stiglitz commission we advocated that the commission should be open to debate with civil society but on this specific
1:01:11
point we failed it is true though that since the the sticky sense v2c Commission in 2009 and
1:01:20
their report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress things have drastically changed we
1:01:28
really have entered a new regime of knowledge where discussing these issues to go beyond growth is now regarded as
1:01:36
its we we experience it today as both academically and politically relevant
1:01:41
whereas 20 years ago we were regarded either as dangerous radicals or sweet
1:01:47
dreamers there is a strong legitimacy in renewing the questions of being gdpn growth and I
1:01:53
guess a true willingness to implement new tools for knowledge and for governmentality
1:02:01
should we all agree on the fact that changing the goal is an emergency we should shift from GDP growth to
1:02:07
Social and ecological Prosperity but the question is how to do it for instance amasya Sen said to the
1:02:15
media right after the commission's work in 2009 that we should organize discussions about the future we want
1:02:23
okay but a discussion with whom and by whom there is concretely a wide range of
1:02:30
legitimation processes to decide what counts and who can't what can't
1:02:37
on the one hand here on your left one of the legitimation process comes from the
1:02:42
world of expertise and the experts are to a certain respect or useful obviously
1:02:48
but they are equipped with their semantic Fields their own tools and representations their values regarding
1:02:55
to what is good and what is desirable and the theoretical Frameworks but not
1:03:01
only do the theoretical Frameworks Embark with them their values but they also face difficulties to adopt new
1:03:07
languages and they take into account and to take into account the social and ecological challenges and this is
1:03:15
especially true when using the monetary language which embarked with it the implicit idea of weak sustainability and
1:03:23
the Mythic possibility of decoupling economic growth from our anthropogenic
1:03:28
footprint [Music]
1:03:35
on the other hand uh here on your right another legitimation process comes from the
1:03:41
world of the individual this word is often called up on the fact that social Prosperity very often
1:03:48
translated in this world into happiness would be far too subjective to be embodied with objective indicators but
1:03:55
in this world these subjectivities are grounded on the spontaneous revelation
1:04:00
of individual preferences and the idea behind is that the sum of
1:04:06
these individual preferences would form the collective interest as if the sum of
1:04:14
of our total spontaneous individual satisfactions could mechanically conduct
1:04:21
us without institutions without political choice to a collective
1:04:26
happiness in between in between there is plenty of
1:04:33
room for a third path probably even more than a third which I qualify as the
1:04:38
world of citizens here the aim is to develop temporary shared conventions about well-being for
1:04:45
all and for social and ecological sustainability all the experiments granted on that
1:04:52
world showed that it is also a very important buy sideway for fostering
1:04:57
democracy in this world the idea is not to tell to talk to everyone but before
1:05:04
all to listen to communities voices in this world the idea is not only to
1:05:10
measure the level of democracy but to practice it the third pass has been experienced in
1:05:17
many territories all over the world it requires among other things a strong
1:05:22
communication ethic a true willingness for the inclusion of the voice of or
1:05:28
I have myself conducted different experiments based on this world of citizens is very demanding it's also
1:05:35
time consuming to build an index of social health and an index of ecological Health the combination of both is one
1:05:43
way there are others to track the possibility of territories local places to be or not virtues on the path of
1:05:50
their social health on the path of their ecological health and on the possibility
1:05:55
of being on a virtuous path on these two inter-twined sides of our common
1:06:00
Humanity I thank you very much [Applause]
1:06:08
thank you Florence
1:06:19
specificity is
1:06:35
the floor is yours thank you very much I want to thank
1:06:40
Philip Lamberts and the 20 MEPS who organized this amazing event can't imagine how much work must have taken
1:06:46
and I also want to thank the assistance to the MEPS that they are the ones who are doing an amazing footwork I know it
1:06:53
because it was my first Showbox really when I was 23 years old I was assistant in the research Office of the parliament
1:06:58
but this building was being built at the time so it's quite a few years but I know how much work it takes just to do
1:07:05
your normal job as an assistant and I can't imagine how much on top of that to mount all this thing here so thank you
1:07:11
very much [Music]
1:07:19
so I want to change a little bit the page compared to the previous presentation and argue that redefining
1:07:25
Prosperity is not just about changing the indicators and the data we use to measure it crucial as this is and it's
1:07:32
very crucial I'm not denying that but I want to argue that it is also a lot about listening to and valuing different
1:07:38
existing models of prosperity that are under attack models other than those based on a
1:07:45
one-way filter consisting only of growth
1:07:53
yeah so I want to talk about the Mediterranean approach to Prosperity but let's see what is this
1:07:58
[Applause] and that and I talk about wasting a
1:08:05
general sense here tend to take the meaning of terms like progress Prosperity or development for granted
1:08:10
but as the recent scientific research on the so-called blue rivers of post-development shows there are many
1:08:16
many different ways civilization across the world have thought and practiced the good life and have come to conceive
1:08:22
well-being from when Revere and sumac outside Latin America to Ubuntu in Africa soarads in India ibadism in the
1:08:29
Arab world or who I among the Chinese to the people I didn't know all these different visions of well-being and I
1:08:34
learned them by reading this book by my colleagues as a Greek I'm Greek you might have
1:08:39
guessed from my name I'm particularly keen on Mediterranean versions of prosperity visions that start in the
1:08:46
words of the late Italian sociologists from Barry Franco casano a different
1:08:51
path that by decommodifying at least in part the sun and the Sea makes them become against third public properties
1:08:58
and the center of Southern identity a path that removes the negative sign from all statistics of the South because it
1:09:05
stops comparing with that which is other than itself all this might sound a little bit poetic
1:09:11
and rhetorical is there empirical evidence on the ground however of such an alternative Mediterranean or Southern
1:09:17
path and how it works studying Mediterranean models of prosperity brought me eight years ago
1:09:24
now to the island of icaria in Greece this is the island apparently where
1:09:30
people forget to die according to the most downloaded and popular article in the New York Times magazine in 2012.
1:09:38
the New York Times said there the story of stamatis moritis the guy in the picture a Greek American who diagnosed
1:09:45
with terminal cancer in 1976 moved back to I career to die
1:09:50
46 years later 102 years old moritis was still alive and cancer-free
1:09:56
so don't rush to go to a career but it's it's true it's a true story the article
1:10:01
written by Dan Bretner a National Geographic fellow shows how the mystery of exceptionally long lives in islands
1:10:08
like icaria or Sardinia in Italy or Okinawa in Japan what is called the Blue zones is not explained just by a single
1:10:15
Factor but by a combination of several things healthy lean mostly vegetarian diets
1:10:21
homegrown food not sure is it work schedules important for all of us here to remember lots of walking lots of
1:10:28
talking and lots of socializing as for example in the careers notorious summer festivals
1:10:36
they are the other picture obviously and they do indeed go like that round until you're dizzy
1:10:41
the article confirms in line with the latest scientific research by psychologists and
1:10:48
this is a study that came out this year by Harvard the university psychologist at Harvard University that published the
1:10:55
study of adult development which is a 95 years long study of following people and looking at what determines their
1:11:01
well-being over time that what makes people happy is not money is not class but it's social relations it's social
1:11:08
bonds it's family community and Friends in academic jargon we use The Not So
1:11:16
Perfect term the growth to signify this model of prosperity which is based on
1:11:21
Simplicity relating and sharing instead of having accumulating and consuming
1:11:28
when I was presenting the growth in a public event in icaria when I was doing my research there a local interrupted me
1:11:34
protesting but this is how we have been living for ages what are you presenting to us here you know
1:11:39
and she was right as we documented with our subsequent research with my authors
1:11:45
in this paper the island indeed sustains a low pace and low impact mode of living
1:11:50
based on diverse economies and persevering communal institutions I'm often told by critics of the growth
1:11:57
that people want more you know more money more stuff more everything how are we going to convince the people it's the
1:12:02
standard argument now but that's not what I observed in in Korea and that's not what I see even in the New Yorkers
1:12:09
who burn a fortune to fly all the way to the career to get just a few days Taste
1:12:14
of the good life people will never buy into the grossa here well they are already doing it and they are paying a
1:12:20
lot actually I don't mean to idealize life in a career
1:12:26
and that has always to be a question reminder here when we look for models
1:12:31
that can Inspire us the locals are interviewed there talk not only of the good life but also of the hard life
1:12:38
how austerity cuts at the time and continued since then we're leaving them without Hospital in schools how cheap
1:12:45
Imports were killing local farms and Orchards leaving few economic Alternatives other than the vulgar type
1:12:51
of tourism and real estate development that one starts finding in Islands nearby
1:12:57
next to a career like Mykonos and in Greece that's like a very important part of the public debate right now the
1:13:02
destruction of the islands and the way of life of Summer life that has been important for all of us Greeks in the
1:13:07
name of tourist development money from tourists paying the debts in the name of GDP growth
1:13:14
my point here Korea or the careers but that has a
1:13:20
minimum ikarias places like Icarus should be allowed to stay the way they are
1:13:26
the thesis I support here is not moral but it's based on evidence there are and
1:13:32
there have always been other models of being and relate relating well-functioning models of prospering
1:13:38
with little we don't need to reinvent anything we don't need to revent models of
1:13:44
prosperity we just have to look around at what already exists and which is being demolished as we
1:13:50
speak these models are not in the Glo in the south in a sense of a geographical South
1:13:56
these models of prosperity I imagine and I'm sure that they are in the French of German Countryside the Alps Scandinavia
1:14:03
the Balkan Mountains or the Hungarian plains that I haven't visited but I'm sure they exist there too
1:14:09
the problem is that unless we talk about them and we learn to see them these different ways of prospering we will
1:14:16
never study them we will never understand them we will never value them and our statistics will keep missing
1:14:21
them so some questions to finish what would the new model of EU convergence look
1:14:28
like one in which not only the South has to become more like the North
1:14:33
in a context of stability and growth and convergence but also the north more like the South
1:14:47
as I said to avoid the labeling of a romantic Greek here I mean South not geographically I mean it
1:14:54
figuratively and in terms of Center and periphery how would we measure progress in regions
1:14:59
like icaria with metrics other than those that put a negative sign on their presumed backwardness and are the
1:15:06
development that supposedly needs help in order to modernize and grow what would the commission program bound
1:15:13
to support alternative Beyond growth models of development really Beyond growth models of development in Europe's
1:15:19
peripheries would look like What policies and what valid interests are destroying or destroying right now
1:15:25
such peripheries in the name of development and modernization and importantly how can we generalize
1:15:32
the wisdom we find in places like icaria bringing healthy diets local low impact
1:15:38
food sustainable work schedules and rhythms and communal forms of producing and celebrating all over Europe
1:15:45
I am a researcher and you know I like to pose questions which is a comfortable position the good thing is that the
1:15:51
European research Council has decided to support us me my colleague Julius Steinberger
1:15:58
and Jason hickel to develop six years of research asking this and many other
1:16:04
questions and I think we're gonna come up with some tentative answers but I think there are many clever people also
1:16:10
in in this room and I'm really happy to discuss them with you thank you [Applause]
1:16:18
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
1:16:29
costume normal
1:16:36
technology Technologies
1:16:57
bless is the donut growth agnostic or actually
1:17:04
advocates for degrowth and post-capitalism do you want a quick answer okay
1:17:10
um donor economics applies to it intends to
1:17:15
be applicable to a very wide range of countries so it's being put into practice in
1:17:21
Malaysia in South Africa in Chile
1:17:26
so it's relevant to many countries and in that sense it says be growth agnostic in the sense that
1:17:33
this is not what we're aiming for we're aiming to be regenerative and distributive by Design
1:17:39
when we come to the high income countries the ones that as you could see from the graphics massively overshoot
1:17:45
planetary boundaries the the imperative is to come back
1:17:50
within planetary boundaries what people call degrowth right come back reduce material use reduce energy
1:17:57
use in that sense to me it's the same as degrowth when we're talking within High
1:18:02
income countries yes
1:18:07
and can those countries have ongoing GDP growth at the same time
1:18:13
I have seen absolutely no evidence that it's possible for those countries to continue pursuing GDP growth while
1:18:19
reducing their material and energy use at the speed and scale that's required even the richest country even even the
1:18:26
best performing countries are only reducing their carbon emissions maybe one or two percent per year
1:18:32
they need to be cutting around eight to ten percent a year so we're nowhere close and that's just carbon emissions
1:18:38
material use is not even beginning to decouple so to me it's extremely
1:18:43
important to end the growth dependency that is currently written into high
1:18:48
income countries across the whole of Europe and the US and all high-income countries to end this growth dependency
1:18:56
so that we can actually create economies that Thrive so yes I believe it's time
1:19:02
to go beyond growth in the very true literal sense go post growth free of
1:19:07
growth dependency so that instead we could become regenerative and distributive
1:19:19
presidents
1:20:12
thank you very much and it was really fascinating interventions and I would like to thank all the all the panelists
1:20:18
for the interventions and and also for all the Applause because I think it was
1:20:23
as they say in French and I think it was just highlighting uh
1:20:32
how the arguments proposed by by the panel has been resonating with
1:20:38
the audience I mean coming um closer to the to the question I think that
1:20:46
here I would like to avoid because I'm not the academician the academic discussion back between the growth
1:20:53
post-growth or I would say this type of definitions I think what is very
1:20:59
important for the people in European Union is that
1:21:05
they can look into the future and make sure that we can
1:21:10
set the the standards and the path forward we should be built on
1:21:16
sustainability and we should be building sustainable economic economic prosperity
1:21:22
and which will be done in a way that we would protect
1:21:28
the unique social model of Europe so therefore I think we didn't discuss that
1:21:34
that much today but I can tell you that in the European commission we are discussing on
1:21:42
extremely frequent bases how to make sure that Europe will remain
1:21:49
competitive in this extremely sharp elbowed world we
1:21:55
just simply see that trade policies economic policies especially of the big powers are becoming enormously assertive
1:22:03
and how to make sure that our economy would be that competitive that it would guarantee is
1:22:11
also in the future decades that we will have that social standards and that
1:22:16
well-being which European citizens rightfully expect and that we can evolve
1:22:21
it into the future how to make sure that our health care would be better how to make sure that we can invest more in
1:22:27
sustainability in Environmental Protection how to guarantee that the future generation of Europeans would
1:22:33
have a proper skills to be a very well placed on the on the labor market where
1:22:39
the Dynamics of employment is changing so dramatically that the top five jobs
1:22:46
which are now sought by different employment agencies
1:22:51
just didn't exist 10 years ago and that's that's the dynamic which we have
1:22:57
to understand and prepare our future generations to deal with it so how to
1:23:03
make it in a sustainable way and at the same time have enough resources to protect and preserve unique European
1:23:11
social model and I think that we have to do it in a way that Europe will always
1:23:18
stream remind our stay among the
