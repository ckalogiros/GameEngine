Beyond Growth opening plenary - Limits to Growth: where do we stand and where do we go from here?

2:09
it's about keeping it as a good home for Humanity that's where what we are going
2:15
to uh to discuss I need to give you uh two housekeeping uh recommendations
2:22
first if you require textual interpretation uh
2:28
there's a speech to text tool on the website that you can use in 23 languages so use that if you need it because
2:36
indeed we are going to have a lot spoken in English maybe in a few other
2:41
languages but I can fully understand and not everybody is comfortable with that and then we are going to try to have
2:49
interactivity and of course with such big attendance it's not always easy and
2:54
for that we are going to use the slido tool there's links there's QR codes at
3:00
the entrance but also uh on the on the website so use it to ask your questions
3:05
interesting thing about slido is that we can see uh what questions are most
3:11
popular what are the ones that really uh need to be uh to be asked first
3:16
but without further Ado in order to uh to stay on schedule I would like to
3:23
welcome and give the floor to president Roberta metzola Roberta is a young
3:28
president of the European Parliament she's actually only The Third Woman
3:34
to be president of this Parliament and she's a forward thinker no doubt it was not a hard job for me to convince her to
3:42
help us because of course without the full engagement of the parliament as an institution the 20 MEPS who organized
3:49
these uh these uh this conference would not have succeeded this is really thanks
3:55
to her her commitment we do not belong to the same political family neither do I with Ursula founder of lion yet we are
4:03
demonstrating here that we can work together for a common cause so Roberta the floor is yours
4:08
[Applause]
4:13
thank you thank you very much dear Philippe dear president of the European commission dear Ursula dear friends you
4:21
know Philip was saying it's not often that we have young people in this room I
4:26
first entered this room as a young pro-european political activist over 20
4:34
years ago I remember looking to my left looking to my right
4:39
and said I don't know these young people around me I come from a different country I might have
4:46
different views different points of ideas but I knew one thing that I
4:52
wanted to leave this room never forgetting the experience that I got from
4:59
looking at the potential of democracy
5:05
of being active towards a country joining the European Union
5:10
and once entering making sure that that promise and hope that the European Union
5:15
gave could be materialized so whenever I entered this room if I don't think of
5:21
all the difficult plenaries we have I also think of the most amazing moments such as when President zelensky
5:27
addressed this room but I think of that first time that I entered this room
5:34
and I would like you as an appeal to tell you that use these three days if you don't know the person to your left
5:39
or to your right to make friends and holds those memories in order to
5:45
make Europe a better place so I'd like to welcome you here to the European Parliament it's not always so
5:51
full on a Monday morning I'd like to see it like this more often I'd like you to to feel at most at home
5:58
in our house of European democracy this was one of the first events if not the
6:04
first event I committed to as soon as I was elected president of the European Parliament because you know Philippe
6:10
you have always been future oriented and someone who has always understood
6:16
and this is rare that our responsibility as politicians
6:22
goes beyond the short-termism of our mandates so today's conference is as apt
6:29
as it is important our world is rapidly changing and right
6:34
now we are dealing with the effects of a global pandemic War on our continent and energy crisis
6:42
inflation all against the black drop of a climate crisis now these crises are
6:49
existential to Europe and to our world Russia's invasion of Ukraine
6:56
it highlighted the cracks in our Energy Systems and in our security strategy
7:03
it has reinforced the necessity of diversifying our energy Supply
7:09
of turning our Focus towards Renewables and sustainable sources of energy
7:14
incorporating further on the issues that are fundamental to our Europe
7:21
when we look back Elizabeth more than a recent geopolitical events these are
7:27
events whose consequences immediately shook us
7:33
but they also showed us the power of unprecedented Unity
7:40
when it comes down to it the European Union can enact a massive amount of
7:46
change in a short time we have recently turned
7:51
to lower the green deal ambition to make the EU climate neutral by 2015. we are making sure
7:58
that Europe is on track to be the world's first climate neutral continent and this is not only about going green
8:05
for Green's sake it is about growth it is about jobs
8:10
and security and ensuring that our continent is on a firm foothold
8:16
for the Next Generation to inherit it that is what sustainability is
8:24
it is growth that we have to deliver for our citizens now as much
8:30
for our future Generations now as with the world's rapidly changes we need to
8:35
change with it we policy makers have to adapt our strategies and sit
8:41
the regulatory framework right for Rapid change we must deliver reforms that deal with these issues to
8:48
showcase the economy and the environment as the same side of the same coin these are in a strip
8:55
inextricably linked to secure to the security of our union now what is our challenge now as we look
9:01
forward over the next difficult months ahead is to ensure that no one falls through
9:10
the cracks or is Left Behind and this means that we need to talk to
9:17
all our citizens this means that when somebody is worried
9:23
about whether they can pay their bills or keep their job that we have the
9:29
answers to that with bold ambition and understanding now
9:35
after the economic crisis some years ago we saw more and more people look away
9:41
from Europe this cannot happen again in a world that has become more unpredictable
9:48
and more dangerous now we have to be careful not to throw away all the painful Lessons Learned
9:56
about European economic and fiscal policies and this is about pushing the concept of better Europe
10:02
that matches the need of more Europe at the cost
10:07
of repeating myself funds are finite debts must be paid back and the only way
10:15
we are able to do that is if we are able to grow our economies sustainably
10:22
and the legislation that we create here that we vote here is about creating new
10:27
jobs new sectors and new Industries giving us a Competitive Edge and I say this with responsibility we can both
10:35
save our planets and protect our ability to make a living
10:42
and support the world around us just a few weeks ago we adopted and this was hard to negotiate
10:49
between different committees in this house different political groups bringing together colleagues that I'm
10:54
proud to sit with today overwhelmingly the social climate fund
11:00
we know that when we look at our societies and the pressure that they are feeling then
11:08
we have to deliver with funds that address and cushion the impact that our
11:14
families our businesses our citizens those who feel marginalized don't feel far away from this room over here
11:23
want us to deliver and that means that we have a long way to go but we can only
11:29
be successful in our fights to deal with this crisis if we are in it
11:35
together that means bringing all of us on board I appeal to you would be to be
11:42
open to be as Frank and discuss with each other to come together and identify
11:48
solutions that we need to take with us as we convince people to vote for this
11:54
European Parliament next year as we look at different countries and say what can
12:00
be done here how can we reach across the table and offer a better
12:06
Europe I think the future of Europe is full of unbridled possibility that we
12:13
must cease and Europe as we have seen we must and should continue to lead by
12:19
example so thank you very much for having me here thank you very much for the possibility of sharing a few thoughts at
12:26
the beginning of the conference it's always different at the beginning when it is at the end I would like to be here
12:33
actually in three days to see what the conclusions are but hold us to account keep us responsible and we will be
12:39
together to deliver thank you very much enjoy [Music]
12:46
[Applause]
12:51
well President Van Der Ryan Libya Ursula I will never forget actually the first time we met it was in this building
12:58
you came into the the room saying well you know a week ago I had no idea that I would be bombarded candidate
13:05
president of the European commission that was I think July 2019. and already
13:11
then you promised us a European green deal and you know I thought I knew you I
13:17
followed your career in Germany and I never heard you speaking about these issues and I felt well is this serious
13:23
fast forward to December 2019 and then comes the communication about the
13:29
European green deal and if you think it's about climate then read it again it's about planetary
13:36
boundaries almost everything is in it actually and let me be honest
13:42
I was surprised and positively surprised now if it weren't for you I don't think we
13:48
would have a European green deal and it's all the more remarkable that you come from the biggest European political
13:55
family the European people's party yet you decided to go for it and indeed well
14:01
you are not God Almighty you cannot just dictate you have to work with colleges laters and we need to find majorities to
14:09
bring the idea of a European green deal forward but probably this initiative
14:14
it's is the most relevant or the most the more
14:19
ambitious seeing that European Union has done so far to try and fit within the
14:25
planetary boundary so for that thank you already and the floor is yours [Applause]
14:30
[Music]
14:36
good morning and thank you very much dear Roberta thank you very much dear Philippe honorable members ladies and
14:42
gentlemen indeed if we look back a little over 50 years ago the club of
14:50
Rome and a group of MIT researchers published the limits of growth report
14:57
it mapped the interaction between population growth the economy
15:03
and the environment and it came 50 years ago to a drastic
15:09
conclusion stop economic and population growth
15:14
or else our planet will not cope and as you know this report has sparked
15:21
a long controversy for instance about the role of new technology in the countering the climate
15:27
change but instead of prolonging these debates I want today to concentrate on one point
15:36
and that is a point that the report got right Beyond any doubt
15:42
and that is the clear message that a growth model
15:47
centered on fossil fuels is simply obsolete [Applause]
15:55
[Music]
16:00
[Applause] this assessment has been confirmed time
16:06
and again the recent ipcc report is just the latest reminder that we need to
16:13
decarbonize our economies as quickly as possible and this is exactly why we put forward
16:21
our European green deal building a 21st century
16:28
clean energy circular economy is one of the most
16:34
significant economic challenges for our times
16:39
the European green deal is not only our plan to fight climate change and become the first climate neutral continent
16:45
it is also our new European growth model for a prosperous
16:52
responsible and resilient economy it is our blueprint for a systematic
16:59
modernization of Europe's industry because in the long run
17:05
only a sustainable economy can be a strong economy only a sustainable economy has a
17:12
resources to invest in healthier and in a fairer tomorrow
17:19
only a sustainable economy empowers us to reach the social targets we set
17:24
ourselves at the Gothenburg and portal social Summit only a sustainable economy generates the
17:32
means to accelerate research and development for clean Technologies
17:39
so 50 years ago the club of Rome could not completely
17:46
envisage for example the potential of green hydrogen
17:51
it could not envisage that we might drive this kind of electric cars of today
17:58
or it might be able not to see the future as we would have for example with
18:04
batteries where we recycle 95 of lithium nickel and Cobalt it's not the daily
18:10
procedure today but we're able to do it but already 50 years ago
18:17
the limit to growth report acknowledged that while fossil fuel-based growth was
18:24
unbearable for the planet Humanity could devise and I quote
18:30
a different growth model model that is sustainable far into the future end of
18:36
quote this is the mission that drives us today and this is Spirit of the European
18:41
green deal we do not have to start from scratch
18:48
our compass in this endeavor are the long-standing values the True
18:56
Values if you get it right of the European social market economy
19:03
our social market economy was never exclusively about economic growth
19:08
it always was about human development it never had the sole goal of market
19:14
efficiency and liberalization to the contrary the social market economy functions in
19:20
the interest of the worker and the community it opens opportunities also to set a
19:28
very clear limits it rewards performance but also
19:33
guarantees protection for the big risks in life Beyond growth
19:40
it focuses on public goods such as Healthcare
19:45
education and skills workers rights personal security Civic engagement and
19:53
governance good governance our social economy market economy if you
19:59
get it right encourages everyone to excel but it also takes care of our fragility
20:07
as human beings the values of the social market economy
20:12
have driven us since the beginning of this commission's mandate
20:18
within the European green deal we have always strived to reconcile jobs with the protection of
20:27
the most fragile people of our society technological innovation
20:33
with climate neutrality and we have stayed True to this approach
20:39
even as new crisis disrupted our everyday lives
20:45
first when the pandemic hit us our recovery plan Next Generation EU
20:52
has focused not only on restarting our economic activities after the lockdowns
20:58
but also on Transforming Our economic model
21:03
with a push to decarbonizing Industries energy and transport with an emphasis on digital skills and
21:10
digital infrastructure with new Investments for schools and hospitals Beyond growth
21:18
Next Generation EU takes care of the Next Generation future
21:25
and then last year when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine
21:33
and the Kremlin rolled out its energy blackmail against us Ed was a tough here
21:41
it did Shake us to the Core but not only did we guarantee Europe's
21:47
energy security there were no blackouts
21:52
and protected vulnerable households and companies with a solidarity contribution from Big
21:58
energy providers we also accelerated massively the
22:04
transition to clean energy and for the very first time in history in 2022 we
22:10
generated more electricity from Sun and wind than we ever did from gas and oil
22:18
while the CO2 emissions globally Rose by one percent
22:24
in the European Union during this year 2022 we managed to cut emissions
22:31
by minus 2.5 percent despite the war
22:36
so this is the living proof it is doable you can cut emissions and have a
22:44
prosperous life it is doable foreign
22:50
a French writer and Nobel Prize winner once said one does not discover new lands without
22:58
having the courage to lose sight of the old Shores
23:04
end of quote and I have to look back once in the
23:10
1970s just one year after the limits of growth report was
23:15
published the Big Oil Crisis began back then
23:22
our predecessors chose to stick to the old Shores not to lose sight of them
23:30
they did not change their growth Paradigm but relied on oil
23:36
and the following Generations have paid the price we also experience massive crisis
23:46
we're choosing a different path we are choosing to discover new lands
23:52
it's not trivial today we are leaving the fossil fuel
23:58
growth model behind us but the new lands are still blurred but
24:03
they are visible we can reach them we know that our children's future depends
24:09
not only on GDP indicators but on the foundations of the world we build for
24:14
them it was Robert Kennedy back in the 1960s
24:22
who famously said and I quote that GDP measures everything
24:30
except that which makes life worthwhile the health of our children
24:37
and the joy of their plague and I'm sure
24:43
had he given his speech today Kennedy would have included the sound of
24:49
Birdsong and the joy of breathing clean air
24:56
today on a very fundamental level we understand Kennedy's wisdom
25:04
the economic growth is not an end in itself
25:09
that growth must not destroy its own foundations that grows must serve people and future Generations
25:17
this is exactly what you will discuss today and the next two days
25:23
so thank you for inviting me and I wish you a very good conference thanks a lot
25:29
[Applause]
25:40
[Music]
25:52
foreign
26:28
so it's now 51 years actually since the report of the club of Rome I remember
26:35
during my first term I visited European Central Bank and I had the opportunity to address
26:43
about 200 staff members of the ECB and I started
26:48
with that with the the limits to growth report and back then it was more like 40 years old
26:56
and the first version I got it was not a question it was a remark a young guy saying that Mr Lambert's okay they said
27:03
that 40 years ago but we're still there right the economy is still functioning and he gave me the impression of someone
27:08
you know falling from a skyscraper and 10 meters of the from the ground well so
27:14
far so good right and indeed there's reason to be yeah
27:20
angry that it took 50 years for these ideas actually for the science
27:27
to permeate policy making I can tell you when I started organizing the first edition of
27:34
this conference five years ago the reception I got from Ursula's from
27:39
the alliance predecessor who was a bit abrasive to be honest and indeed only one member of the
27:46
commission back then showed up it was Marietta westia from Denmark she was the
27:52
only one willing to engage even though she did not have really a background in these ideas today is quite uh different
28:00
but so it's also as I said at the opening with a sense of joy that I
28:06
welcome you but also with a sense of gravity because the clock has been ticking and
28:11
if you look and I think of my my kids age between 27 and 35 if you look
28:17
rationally at the world around us there's many reasons to believe it's
28:22
already too late yet accepting that it is too late is a
28:27
form of self-fulfilling prophecy if we believe that it's too late
28:33
then we will forgive well forget any effort and then
28:38
the Fatal uh end is certain the only way to seize the chance of giving a future
28:45
to humanity to believe to believe that indeed we can find a way we can find a
28:51
way to uh to bring all societies within the planetary boundaries and I'm very
28:57
glad that indeed during these three days what we are going to try to achieve is to infuse this debate in European policy
29:04
making that's what we are really trying to do and uh you could hear from the the
29:10
commission president and the commission is very important because it's a source of legislation in Europe that these
29:16
ideas have have begun to permeate at the very top of the uh of the European
29:22
commission and that's good because indeed if you look at the 27 heads of states and governments
29:29
I would challenge you to name me one I could maybe name one but just one who
29:35
would have demanded a green deal from the European commission who would have demanded a project a transformational
29:43
project such as this one it was not on demand of the member states it was
29:48
really an initiative from the European institutions and it's good that so far
29:53
we have been able to book progress but as we make progress we meet more resistance because indeed the current
30:01
system has winners it has winners and these will not willingly surrender their
30:09
profits so it's a struggle but it's first a struggle for hearts and Minds
30:14
you know it's about winning the narrative within the public debate and that's what we are going to try to do so
30:21
I will invite the three speakers of our first panel Sandrine you're there already come on so as I
30:29
speak stuff happens in my bank so we have Sandra index on the left president co-president of the club of Rome it was
30:36
fitting that indeed [Applause]
30:44
it was it was fitting that we would have a soldering here because indeed it all
30:49
started with the limits to growth report and that was really pre-science but they
30:55
are presion but actually the science was there so they they they spent time and energy to try to bring it together but
31:02
no one can say that the facts were not there then we believe Jason hickel from
31:07
the uh autonomous University of Barcelona one of the many uh scientists
31:13
who will uh give us food for thought in uh in these
31:18
three days because indeed what we want is fact-based policies that's what we use
31:30
and then you were one of the the youngest leaders
31:38
climate leaders here in Belgium on the on the footsteps of the the the climate
31:45
strike started in uh in in Sweden and and frankly you have impressed me ever
31:51
since because it's not only the anger that drives you it's the hope it's the hope
31:56
that indeed we can make it happen we are alive and we want to stay alive and
32:02
indeed we need that kind of energy to move forward so I will give you all three in that order the floor uh for 10
32:09
minutes or so and then we will try to have an interaction first between you and then hopefully with the floor uh so
32:17
again use uh use slido uh last remark we have tried and actually it was not that
32:23
difficult we have tried to have gender balanced panels all along the conference
32:29
I do believe that indeed there's something to be said about I would say the masculine dimension of
32:36
the current exploitative Paradigm and I do believe that uh I do believe that
32:45
if you want to get out of this Paradigm probably probably will we will need to make it
32:52
more feminine thank you [Applause] [Music]
32:57
[Applause] well what a wonderful opening I find it
33:04
quite uncanny actually when uh president of the European commissioner Ursula Wonderland
33:10
decides to read a speech that mentions not only the limits to growth but probably half of what I wanted to give
33:16
to you this morning I could actually step down but I think it demonstrates the nature of this incredible house and
33:24
it demonstrates the nature of the possibility of bringing together a
33:29
multi-party solution to move Beyond growth so I do want to start by giving credit
33:35
to Ursula Wonderland as you have Philippe for her exemplary leadership and with the support of this house she
33:42
has steered Europe through a global pandemic towards a European green and Social Deal
33:48
and also the response to an ongoing war in Ukraine we could think about the Despair and the
33:55
pain of the Ukraine today but today I want to bring you some hope we won't be able to end the rolling
34:02
crisis but we can build more resilient societies better able to deal with
34:08
shocks and stresses build societies that support transformation not reject it
34:16
the first glimmer of hope is the very fact that we are here today for the next three days
34:22
in the European Parliament talking about the root cause of the Pali crisis the
34:27
obsession with growth this is genuine leadership and I applaud
34:32
you Philippe and your colleagues for their Vision to host this conference let's make sure though we translate all
34:39
these speeches into action when we leave these hallways on Wednesday [Applause]
34:49
ladies and gentlemen it is not difficult the needed policies to put Europe further on the path towards a more
34:55
sustainable and inclusive society and economy have their anchors in the eu's own history Traditions initiatives and
35:04
legislation notably these anchors are found in the treaty on the European Union the
35:09
European commission's own strategic dashboards and the European green deal it shows that by keeping the overarching
35:16
vision for an economic model that underpins the European green and Social Deal and delivers greater Prosperity the
35:24
European institutions can and should set the tone for a future policy
35:30
our goal now is to bring the member states and citizens on this journey
35:35
but before I talk more about growth I want to say a few words about democracy in the same way that President medsolo
35:42
indicated how important Europe's democracy is it is now very obvious that
35:47
the idea of growth and democracy are inextricably linked the discussion today
35:53
comes one year ahead of big elections in major democracies including the United States the UK and of course the European
36:01
Union in these elections every party from left to right will talk about economic growth they will all have their
36:08
solutions to drive growth the media will challenge them on whether these Solutions will actually Foster growth
36:15
but the growth narrative is never changed we are all here to change that we are
36:22
all here to show that the Emperor or the empress has no clothes
36:28
[Applause] [Music]
36:37
democracies are under threat social tensions are rising citizens simply
36:43
don't believe the political leads are on their side we're seeing a slide back from democracy at the very moment we
36:49
need strong democracies that are able to take historic decisions giant leaps to
36:55
transform economies away from luxury carbon and biosphere consumption
37:00
I will make the case that we can have strong democracies or we can continue our dangerous obsession with growth but
37:07
we can't have both the center cannot hold the most important thing we can do right
37:13
now is invest in Social cohesion at the heart of that is human well-being
37:19
Economic Security and ecological resistance not growth last year indeed was the 50th
37:27
anniversary of our similar report that the club of Rome the limits to growth and at an event to commemorate that one
37:33
of the key authors Dennis Meadows described the moment when he presented
37:38
to a similar group of people not as many youth I must say an assembly of politicians and business
37:45
leaders and he said he was extremely nervous this is 1972. he thought he was wasting
37:53
their time he thought he was going to spend an hour telling them the things they already knew that exponential
37:58
growth on a finite planet with hat will have catastrophic consequences for people and planet
38:05
Dennis said he was simply astounded that this appeared news to his audience
38:10
yet here we are 50 years on and somehow this continues to be news not a reality
38:18
the limits to growth warned about overshoot and collapse in the 21st century the scenarios indicated that the
38:25
human footprint could end up exceeding the carrying capacity of planet Earth but what has happened since
38:31
today 50 years later it is a historical fact that political leaders chose to follow the most destructive scenarios of
38:38
the limits to growth the human footprint has continued to grow and it has now been established
38:44
scientifically that we have exceeded six of nine planetary boundaries
38:50
most worrying is climbing yet the limits to growth science is still challenged there is an assumption
38:56
that technology will fix the problem the only technology that will fix this
39:01
at this time is a time machine to go back 50 years [Applause]
39:13
it's not technology we need this obsession with technology we need to
39:19
change the economic Paradigm and we need political leadership
39:24
[Applause] [Music] so last year myself and my colleagues
39:33
published a new analysis Earth for all a survival guide for Humanity we looked at this transformation head-on
39:41
and we said in one single human lifetime we must transform we explore just two
39:48
scenarios which we call too little too late right now business as usual and the
39:53
giant leap to develop the scenarios we brought together a transformational economics Commission of economists and thought
40:00
leaders from across the globe and a novel System Dynamics model called Earth for all
40:05
one of the Novelties of the model is that we included two indices a well-being index and a social tension
40:11
index the two little too late scenario is essentially the road the world is on now
40:17
incremental progress on climate change poverty gender empowerment and food
40:22
systems change it is a world of regional rivalries it could have been called The Road to Hell
40:29
in our scenario we will cross the two degree climate limit within a few decades
40:35
and we know that there is a very high risk of Crossing multiple tipping points including the loss of the Greenland ice
40:42
sheets and critical parts of Antarctica in this scenario business as usual we
40:48
destabilize the planet for all future generations to clean up the mess
40:55
the wealth is distributed much like today with the richest on Earth taking almost all the gains and unsurprisingly
41:01
this reads this leads to Rising social tensions we conclude that Rising social
41:07
tensions will reduce the capacity of society to act rationally and strongly
41:12
in the face of adversity just like today this is not stability people this is not
41:19
security [Music] that was the first scenario the second
41:26
scenario is the giant leap we wanted to identify a small set of actions a
41:31
minimum viable product to reach as many sustainable development goals in Europe's vision of a social and green
41:37
region we wanted to take a systems approach to explore if we can achieve an acceptable level of well-being for the
41:43
global majority on a finite planet we conclude that nothing less than the following five extraordinary turnarounds
41:50
are needed to have well-being for all while respecting planetary boundaries ending poverty addressing gross
41:57
inequality achieving full gender Equity transforming the food system and the way we eat transitioning to clean energy and
42:05
efficient energy we argue that these five extraordinary turnarounds and the set of economic reforms that will drive
42:11
them form the basis of a well-being economy it is not a blueprint but more of a guide for systemic transformation
42:18
in this scenario poverty ends a generation earlier than too little too late we see gender empowerment in one
42:25
generation not ten we see a switch to healthier plant-based diets there is still meat consumption but at
42:31
sustainable levels and we have carbon dioxide emissions every decade to reach Net Zero by 2050.
42:39
the economic model everywhere is circular regenerative and efficient material consumption of unsustainable
42:46
resources is rained in fossil energy phased out and we see a significant
42:51
redistribution of wealth this is achieved through more government
42:56
expenditure on health and education coming back to what the president said what is most essential
43:03
progressive taxation more empowered workers through stronger unions and more representation on boards full gender
43:10
equity in leadership positions but most importantly in this scenario we
43:16
dramatically see social tensions fall and well-being rise in this scenario we introduce a
43:23
universal basic dividend operating like a universal basic income with dividends coming to all people sharing the wealth
43:30
of the Global Commons and public goods who's taking the wealth now it is not properly redistributed
43:37
this is not utopic this is what is fair and just and what a society in
43:44
transformation is all about why do we think this is important we
43:49
know the giant leap will be disruptive we're talking about a complete shake-up this is everything everywhere all at
43:56
once it will create shocks but if it is to succeed then we must bring the
44:02
majority of people along the journey it must be fair and it must provide genuine
44:07
hope for a better future for the majority there are a huge array of ideas that can
44:13
drive the giant leap scenario we don't see it as either or we will need to adopt several economic models at once
44:19
Mission economies are perfectly compatible with donut economics which is
44:25
compatible with post-growth thinking we will need green growth we need growth and Renewables in regenerative farming
44:33
the least developed nations of course need to grow but they need to grow differently
44:38
we need to work in tandem to enhance a different type of growth that Fosters an economy that Services people planet and
44:45
prosperity at the same time not windfall profits for example on the back of energy transport or food poverty
44:53
we can see more countries openly discussing well-being economies we already have five well-being economies
45:00
in New Zealand Iceland Wales Scotland and Finland and in recent weeks the Irish President Michael Higgins
45:06
challenged the country's obsession with growth and we also see Canada and Costa Rica and so many other countries that
45:12
are saying enough is enough a growth economy and extractive economy
45:17
is not servicing my country my people this planet our home
45:24
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
45:30
so ladies and gentlemen this is a message to politicians campaigning on an economic growth platform people don't
45:37
want economic growth they want Economic Security they want ecological stability
45:42
they want government investment in their future and economic and financial
45:47
systems that Foster their well-being if we need growth it is a growth in Social
45:54
cohesion to empower democratic governments to act that is the priority
46:00
the opportunity for the EU is huge this is equivalent to a new brand
46:07
Marshall Plan within a single generation the EU could achieve energy security food security and economic security how
46:15
do we achieve it we need leadership from the EU to shift the economic system for
46:20
one that is grounded in power and profit and patriarchy to one that is anchored
46:26
in people planet and prosperity let us make sure that this becomes our
46:34
future all of us and let us make sure that this becomes our reality together
46:40
thank you thank you
46:51
thank you thank you well obviously
46:56
[Music] [Applause] obviously you can
47:02
write some electoral programs right
47:08
well I'm afraid I won't run next year but uh but at least I hope it will
47:13
Infuse a public debate Jason over to you okay thank you so much and thank you for
47:20
the very powerful and compelling speech it's an honor for me to be here and
47:25
thank you all for joining us and thank you for the invitations uh from the political parties I want to use my time
47:31
with you to speak directly and practically to the extraordinary impasse that we clearly face as a civilization
47:39
we are at 1.2 degrees of global warming and already the effects are clearly disastrous devastating planetary changes
47:45
are playing out before us in real time it is critically important that we make
47:51
every effort to limit global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees as possible in line with the Paris agreement scientists
47:57
warn that pushing Beyond this level towards two degrees is likely to trigger several major tipping points in the
48:03
earth system and beyond this level we will not be able to adapt
48:08
yes over the past decade the EU has reduced its emissions some politicians
48:13
have hailed this as evidence of green growth but remember when it comes to
48:18
climate mitigation what matters is speed we must reduce emissions fast enough to
48:24
stay within Fair shares of the carbon budget for 1.5 degrees for high income countries this is
48:31
extremely challenging because they have very high levels of energy use and high energy use makes sufficiently rapid
48:37
decarbonization very difficult to achieve the EU is not on track to meet
48:43
its Paris obligations not even close at existing rates of mitigation it will
48:48
take several hundred years to cut emissions to zero even if the green deal brings everyone to the speed of the best
48:55
performing countries Denmark and the Netherlands the EU will still blow its fair share of the carbon budget many
49:01
times over there's nothing green about this it's a recipe for disaster much faster
49:07
mitigation is needed thank you [Music]
49:18
and climate is not the only crisis that we Face we're also overshooting five other planetary boundaries including
49:24
staggering rates of biodiversity loss driven mainly by excess material use in
49:29
the world economy and here again it's the high income countries which have disproportionately high levels of
49:35
material use which are overwhelmingly responsible for driving this crisis what's more the constant hunt for
49:42
capitalist growth in the EU and other high-income economies relies on a constant plunder of goods and resources
49:49
and labor from the global South [Applause]
50:00
input output data shows thus consumption in rich countries
50:05
about half of all the material consumption in rich countries is not appropriated from the global South through unequal exchange this drains
50:12
poorer countries of wealth that could be used for developments it colonizes their lands it produces global inequality and
50:21
it means the social and ecological costs of growth are externalized to vulnerable communities
50:26
[Applause] [Music]
50:32
this Arrangement is wildly destructive and wildly unjust
50:39
the science is very clear rich countries must substantially reduce their use of energy and materials so that we can
50:46
decarbonize fast enough to stay under 1.5 degrees so that we can reverse other
50:51
forms of ecological breakdown and to release the global south from the grip of neocolonial extraction
50:58
but this brings us to a paradox Europe has extremely high levels of
51:03
energy material use vastly overshooting planetary boundaries and yet nonetheless still fails to meet many basic human
51:11
needs 40 million people cannot access nutritious food and cannot Heat their
51:16
homes 95 million people face the risk of poverty tens of millions more cannot
51:22
access decent housing why it's because our economic system is fundamentally
51:28
undemocratic our productive capacities are controlled by capital and mobilized around what is
51:34
profitable to Capital rather than what is necessary for human well-being and ecology
51:40
[Applause]
51:48
so we end up with perverse forms of production SUVs and fast fashion and fossil fuels and advertising instead of
51:54
public transit nutritious food renewable energy affordable housing our economic system fails in both ecological and
52:02
social terms so we Face a double challenge we need to transition to an economy that meets human needs and
52:09
achieves social progress while also substantially reducing energy and material use
52:14
[Applause] this can be achieved through efficiency
52:21
improvements yes and we should embrace the power of technological change we also know that this is not enough in and
52:27
of itself in a growth-oriented economy gains from efficiency are diminished by the scale
52:33
effects of ever increasing production if we are to overcome this problem and Achieve our ecological goals we need to
52:40
transition through a post-growth economy and reorganize production around well-being and ecology
52:46
the first step is clear we must abandon GDP growth as an objective Simon kuznets the man who
52:53
invented the GDP metric himself warned that it should never be used as a measure of economic and social progress
53:00
it does not distinguish between what is good and what is harmful and it does not account for social and ecological costs
53:07
we urgently need alternative indicators but the conference believing that this is
53:13
all that needs to be done if you are speeding toward a cliff it is not enough to Simply fiddle with a speedometer in
53:19
your car you have to deal with the underlying problem think about it this way
53:26
the dominant assumption in economics right now is that every industry must increase
53:31
production every year regardless of how destructive it is and regardless of whether or not we actually need it
53:38
this is an irrational way to run an economy at the best of times in the middle of an ecological emergency
53:43
it is clearly Madness instead we need to determine democratically what kinds of production
53:50
we need to be doing and what kinds of production are clearly destructive and should be scaled down
53:58
this focuses the minds Empirical research shows that the single most powerful way to improve well-being and
54:04
social outcomes is to expand and decommodify Universal public services
54:10
and by
54:17
foreign Healthcare and education yes but also housing public transit Energy Water
54:24
internet nutritious food for all high quality Universal Services should
54:30
be a core objective of EU policy let us mobilize our productive forces to ensure
54:35
that everyone can access what is necessary to live a decent life
54:40
in addition we must invest in ambitious Public Works programs build renewable
54:46
energy improve public transit insulate homes install efficient appliances restore ecosystems these are Urgent
54:54
socially necessary tasks and we cannot just wait around for Capital to decide they are worth doing we must mobilize to
55:01
do them directly and fast harnessing the power of Public Finance and Industrial
55:06
policy such a program can and should also include a job guarantee empowering
55:12
people to train and participate in the most important Collective projects of Our Generation doing dignified
55:18
meaningful socially valuable work with workplaces democracy and living wages
55:24
[Applause] [Music]
55:31
think about the power of this approach it allows us to achieve ecological objectives but it also abolishes
55:37
unemployment something that growth never does it abolishes Economic Security which growth never does it ensures good
55:43
lives for all regardless of fluctuations in aggregate output this liberates us
55:49
from growth imperatives and stabilizes the economy now as
55:55
you were the socially necessary sector as the social Foundation down socially less necessary forms of
56:02
production fossil fuels are the obvious one here we need binding targets to wind
56:08
this industry down
56:13
but we also need to reduce production of private jets SUVs commercial airlines Mansions industrial beef fast fashion
56:20
advertising arms cruise ships there are huge chunks of our economy that are
56:26
mostly organized around capital accumulation and are wasteful and destructive and totally irrelevant to
56:31
human well-being we can also ban the practice of planned obsolescence and introduce policy to extend product
56:37
lifespans if our products last twice as long we will need half as many finally
56:43
we urgently need to cut the purchasing power of the rich using basic sensible
56:49
policy tools such as wealth taxes and maximum income ratios Recent research
56:54
[Music] [Applause]
57:02
Recent research shows that millionaires alone are on track to burn 72 percent of
57:08
the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degrees this is an egregious assault on humanity and the living world and none
57:15
of us should accept it we need to realize that it is irrational and unjust for us to continue devoting our energy
57:22
and resources to supporting an over-consuming Elites in the middle of a climate emergency
57:28
[Applause] [Music]
57:34
policies like these would dramatically reduce energy and material use allowing us to achieve rapid decarbonization
57:40
while at the same time improving social outcomes and if we find that our society
57:45
requires less labor to produce the things that we need we can shorten the working week give people more free time
57:52
and share necessary labor more evenly thus permanently preventing any unemployments unemployment is an
57:58
artificial scarcity and it can be abolished is it affordable yes by
58:03
definition yes as Keynes pointed out anything we can actually do
58:09
we can afford in terms of protective productive capacity we can pay for it and when it
58:14
comes to productive capacity we have far more than enough deploying public finances and Industrial policy simply
58:21
shifts this capacity away from wasteful production and Elites accumulation to
58:26
achieve democratically ratified social and ecological objectives
58:32
some will say the sounds utopian but the policies I've mentioned here happen to be extremely popular Universal
58:39
Public Services a public job guarantee more equality an economy focused on well-being and ecology rather than
58:46
growth polls and surveys show strong majority support for these ideas an
58:51
official citizens assemblies in several European countries have called for precisely this kind of transition
58:57
a post-growth deal along these lines can be a popular and feasible political
59:03
agenda but Europe is not an island addressing our Global crises requires
59:10
that all countries succeed or none of us do governments in the global South also need the freedom to mobilize their own
59:16
production around human needs and ecological objectives rather than servicing consumption and accumulation
59:22
in the global North this requires
59:27
thank you this requires reversing IMF structural adjustment programs canceling unpayable
59:33
debts and ending an equal Exchange
59:44
none of this will happen on its own it will require a major political struggle
59:49
against those who profit so prodigiously from the status quo to get there we must
59:55
build alliances between environmentalists and labor movements and other Progressive political
1:00:01
formations this is not a time for timid responses tweaking around the edges of
1:00:06
an obviously failing system this is a time for courage is there hope yes
1:00:13
but our hope can only ever be as strong as our struggle so build the struggle
1:00:19
focus on the future we need adjust an ecological economy for the 21st century
1:00:24
thank you [Applause] [Music]
1:00:39
[Applause] thank you Jason [Music]
1:00:45
you describe the our current system as a democratic and indeed if democracy is the government of the People by the
1:00:51
people for the people then indeed uh you can you can say that it fails uh to meet
1:00:58
the at least the last test uh because indeed those who are profiting from public policy uh are not uh the the
1:01:06
general public the the citizens but the happy few but I would argue
1:01:12
that the event that we are holding in this place is maybe held in the right place because
1:01:19
indeed this Parliament has power and the best proof of the power of this Parliament
1:01:25
is the amount of lobbying that we are getting that's the best proof that indeed we
1:01:31
have the power to shape our future if we didn't they wouldn't spend zillions trying to
1:01:37
influence us so what is really missing is the collective will to use this power
1:01:43
uh to do well now of course we don't have all the competencies and especially what you said about taxation is still
1:01:49
pretty much member State competence but at least I would argue that there's more
1:01:55
Progressive views about taxation here than there are in many uh National parliaments but Adelaide you have been
1:02:01
trying to influence us for years now together with the the youthful climate
1:02:07
movement tell us uh what are the next steps and how do you see the thing going
1:02:12
[Applause] foreign
1:02:20
[Applause] for me to speak after such eminent
1:02:26
speakers that could be uh my professors or even my parents
1:02:39
70 years ago Europe was built on a strong desire for peace
1:02:45
believing that it was necessary to develop creative efforts with the dangers that threatened it
1:02:52
later when The Architects of Europe This decided to Institute institutionalize
1:02:59
the Union designs a promise to defend Freedom principle democracy human rights and the
1:03:07
rule of law for All European citizens they committed to implement Implement
1:03:13
policies ensuring parallel progress of its economy its social cohesion and its
1:03:19
Environmental Protection the principle of Europe brought the hope
1:03:24
for a new era of all those who had experienced the horror of war
1:03:30
They Carried the dream that solidarity between nations would
1:03:35
protect them from becoming the victims of human self-destruction
1:03:40
a dream that tomorrow will be better than yesterday based on the belief that
1:03:46
industrial and economical progress will guarantee happiness for most of us
1:03:51
a dream that controlling nature will ensure a wealthy development to
1:03:56
societies for years economic growth has been beneficial and brought prosperity to
1:04:02
Europe treated jobs reduced property stimulated Innovation mechanization and productivity
1:04:09
while it is while there is indeed a relationship between growth and human progress be Beyond a certain point and
1:04:17
Europe has long passed this point this relationship is broken
1:04:25
Beyond these points economic growth is harmful
1:04:31
it damages the planets and human communities increases inequalities and generates
1:04:38
stress and depression the path towards peace was mapped out in
1:04:45
the 20th century as a highway aligning economic growth social equality welfare
1:04:51
and exploitation of people and nature less than a century later
1:04:58
the belief of growth towards the infinite is now facing nightmares
1:05:05
nightmares of droughts melting glossier floods
1:05:10
loss of biodiversity loss of ecosystems non-respects of Human Rights
1:05:17
widening gap between poverty and wealth and Sciences are crystal clear
1:05:25
the planets is warming and this is clearly caused by certain types of
1:05:30
humans activities and Europe at this actual rates will not hold their 2000
1:05:38
2030 targets today it is obvious that Europe has
1:05:45
defaulted its promise of a parallel growing progress and has delivered to
1:05:51
its Young Generation two incompatible GPS navigation system
1:05:58
economic growth on the one hand and the carbon neutrality Society
1:06:04
respectful of the planetary boundaries on the other
1:06:09
during this conference we will hear experts stating that those two tracks are not compatible
1:06:17
the Daydream of green growth made possible by decoupling economic growth and greenhouse gases is over
1:06:25
[Applause]
1:06:31
thank you and that is why the younger generation
1:06:37
stood up all around the world demanding to their Nation to fulfill their
1:06:43
political duty to protect citizens from the announced dangers they rose up with Greta in Sweden Louisa
1:06:51
and Germany came in France Martina in Italy Dominica and Poland Salman in Denmark and Luna and myself in Belgium
1:06:58
and many many many others that are probably in this room today from Nordic
1:07:03
Pine Forest to the icing mountains of the Alps from the rural Basin to the Mediterranean Coast they carry the same
1:07:11
Chorus Line it is time to lift our nations from
1:07:16
quicksand of unlimited growth to the solids Hard Rock of inclusive prosperity
1:07:24
[Applause]
1:07:31
but these youth refuse to believe that the geographers
1:07:36
of these GPS will not pay attention to the ipcc warning they refuse to believe that the
1:07:44
market Wars of the Union will lead to their Fleet out of the planetary boundaries they refuse to believe that
1:07:53
the democracy and peace guards are forgetful of their descendants
1:07:59
and that is why they are still mobilized today
1:08:06
there are those asking the climate and social activists when will you be satisfied
1:08:14
we can never be satisfied as long as the planetary boundaries are not considered
1:08:20
as a horizon not to be exceeded for the good of humans and living organisms
1:08:27
intertwined [Music]
1:08:35
we can never be satisfied when our as long as our economy is not
1:08:41
organized around human prosperity and ecological stability rather than a constant accumulation of capital
1:08:49
we cannot be satisfied as long as Europe does not recognize its historical
1:08:55
responsibility not only in the CO2 stuck in the atmosphere but also in the
1:09:01
exploitation of resources from countries that are today mostly
1:09:07
suffering from the consequences of climate change [Applause]
1:09:17
we cannot be satisfied as long as the climate crisis is not seen as a
1:09:22
fundamental challenge for our democracy and not as an easily bypass rock thanks
1:09:28
to technology the technology model is seductive like
1:09:34
the science for illices it tells us that we have the possibility thanks to human genius and technological
1:09:41
tools to organize the world to our will but this narrative contributes to
1:09:48
political inaction and does not pass the science tests
1:09:54
we cannot be satisfied as long as policies remain inconsistent
1:10:01
fossil fuels is still subsidized and all companies continue to Prospect and drill
1:10:07
new wells industrial and intensive agriculture is still being imposed
1:10:14
we cannot be satisfied as long as European leaders demand a regulatory
1:10:20
break on environmental standards
1:10:32
we cannot be satisfied as long as words and actions remain that
1:10:39
dissonant I have come here to remind Europe of the
1:10:46
fierce urgency of noun this is no time to abandon the youth on
1:10:52
the shore of equal anxiety nor is it the time of giving them misleading maps of
1:10:58
the future [Applause] [Music]
1:11:06
I have come here hoping that those days will stimulate new narratives for Europe
1:11:13
now it is time for Europe to adjust its original wish
1:11:19
of protecting its citizens from self-destruction accepting that self-destruction takes
1:11:27
the form of War of War but also the form of entreprene
1:11:35
now it is time to consider seriously the interwoven causes
1:11:43
of the several crises climates energy migration security
1:11:51
now it is time to redefine prosperity and renew
1:11:56
indicators accordingly inspired by those who include Education
1:12:01
Health Care well-being and many more an inspiring those who still stick to the
1:12:09
GDP as their molecular indicator
1:12:14
despite timid's and insufficient Tremors in view of stakes of the climate
1:12:19
emergency despite CO2 still increasing
1:12:25
despite many banks and states still financing and implementing projects
1:12:30
destroying lands species and people
1:12:36
I still have a dream I have a dream like many other youth
1:12:42
it is a dream deeply rooted in the European and Democratic dream
1:12:48
I have a dream that moving away from the business as usual model of infinite growth is
1:12:55
possible for All European nations I have a dream that our political
1:13:02
institutions will break the illusion of autonomy and omnipine omnipotence of
1:13:09
humans and that they will rethink democracy in connection with nature living creature
1:13:16
and respect of all human communities
1:13:22
I have a dream that Europe will will Revitalize our
1:13:27
democracies by increasing and widest widening citizens participation
1:13:32
developing debates and decision spaces because the transition needs a
1:13:39
collective boarding I have a dream that solidarity will remain the core of
1:13:46
the European Union building a fair and socially viable transition
1:13:54
and from dream to narrative to debate to policies
1:14:00
I hope this conference holds a torch to draw new maps for Europe
1:14:06
feeds rooted in this loving Earth and eyes
1:14:11
on the enlightening starts thank you

1:14:54
thank you thank you Adelaide thanks to all three of you because you have shared
1:15:01
I would say both gravitas we are in a life-threatening situation
1:15:06
but hope that we can do something about it and I think that's uh that's probably the key
1:15:12
message that I take from this session well in the interest of time I really wonder whether we have time for
1:15:18
interaction right now I think a lot of things have been said and we will have three days to interact
1:15:25
actually during the sessions and uh in the corridors the big corridors of of
1:15:31
this Parliament but once he is certain is that I remember what well 20 maybe 30
1:15:39
years ago I remember seeing the movie Terminator 2.
1:15:46
and I was struck at the time by the opening sequence of that movie
1:15:51
in which a totally destroyed world is uh is uh how should I say it's
1:15:58
basically a battle Zone where robots Killer Robots are actively
1:16:05
hunting human resistance and these Killer Robots are owned by the owners of
1:16:11
capital and you might think it's an allegory but actually at that time while Killer
1:16:16
Robots didn't exist maybe the threat of human destruction was not yet or
1:16:22
planetary destruction was not yet clear but actually when I think of it
1:16:27
this is clearly a possibility collapse into barbarism that's what we are facing and sometimes
1:16:34
I hear people saying yeah but you should have a positive narrative but acting on reality in my view starts
1:16:41
with seeing reality including seeing the risks that we are
1:16:48
looking at and then we can have hope but hope cannot be blind
1:16:55
hope cannot be blind to reality and indeed one of the strong
1:17:00
or should I say forces for Human Action is the will to live
1:17:06
to survive and I think that is what can drive us out of this Quagmire so I would
1:17:13
suggest that we keep it at that because I'm asked to finish at a half sharp I've
1:17:19
three housekeeping things that I have to share with you no four actually so the
1:17:25
the first four panels will start at 11 and so this is why we try to finish at
1:17:30
house password that you have time A to find your way but also maybe to take a coffee or something
1:17:37
take in the hemicycle so the panels that were most sought after when you
1:17:42
registered will take place in the in the plenary all the others will be in the big rooms
1:17:48
across the the Esplanade that actually you use the corridors of the parliament to get there but count on five ten
1:17:55
minutes to get there because this is a big building you know it's greater Dimension is 340 meters so uh that's the
1:18:02
place of human democracy so of European democracy sorry uh now coffee breaks uh they are for the uh
1:18:13
for meetings that take place in this room the coffee breaks are in the place called Yodi menu in space which is
1:18:20
actually one floor uh below this one you will find it easily in the it's the the
1:18:26
the the the the round stairs that uh that are just uh behind this room and
1:18:32
for panels two to four the coffee breaks are in front of the meeting rooms over
1:18:38
there so you can go directly there and you will find uh you will find them all
1:18:44

1:18:50
days so feel free to make use of them and then uh yes there's many conference
