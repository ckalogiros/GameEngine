Beyond Growth plenary 6 â€“ The power of economic models on decision-making and society at large



[Music] ladies and gentlemen and those of you in
0:12
the corridors that would like to join the plenary could you please more move
0:18
forward and try to find your seats so that we can start going uh as always you know the
0:27
time is the time is going to run out and we don't want to still do much of the
0:32
time from the upcoming plenary eyes then firstly a word of warning
0:42
I'm Economist by education I'm a college ecologist by heart
0:51
and I'm politician in everyday life
0:58
so whatever you take as good or bad but let's say that I know the mergers but
1:04
the vice is also about the the profession of economists and the
1:09
education of economists and uh let me start with the the fact
1:16
why I got a bit frustrated ages ago when I studied it economics is not physics
1:25
it's not mathematics [Applause]
1:34
it's not Natural Science where one plus one can hold only and always be too
1:42
and where if you prefer a to B you always prefer a to c
1:48
and this is what the whole profession right actually is trying to do
1:54
wannabe Natural Science this is the truth
2:00
but well it's a problem but what is our problem is that all the politicians are
2:06
take it like a natural science they listen the economists the Ministers
2:12
of the finance and economics what is the GDB are we growing how much
2:19
depth do we have oh gosh now we need to
2:24
same now we can't spend and it blissfully unaware millions of
2:32
things just to mention how this kind of a gendered worldview reflects on economics
2:39
it's always the puppy that comes with the money to house and it's Mama that
2:45
spends the money right look the amount of guys
2:52
in trade agriculture Finance
2:58
at the women in education Ministries social and environment
3:05
have you noticed that always when you put the money on cement iron and asphalt
3:12
no matter what it's an investment and you never talk about care economy
3:19
you need to care the roads and that the roads are expanded because
3:26
they cost so much but can say what what happens when you educate people and you
3:31
take care of say ill people and people with mental stress and try to patch them
3:38
it is expenditure that we cannot afford if the GDP doesn't
3:47
go up and so forth actually the whole information and analytics is going
3:54
in dreadfully wrong direction and We Know It And still we don't know how to how to
4:02
act and what to do and another small example going to
4:09
Nature you know discounting system how you can sort of a predic future or future value
4:17
use let's say for example in Investments by with the formula uh having this
4:26
today's value to be
4:31
seen in the future and always oil
4:38
and cold that has been very profitable in the future it's the past performance
4:45
gives High figures so it's a good investment but what about solar power
4:53
wind a lot of sustainable Investments who do not have the track record
5:00
Risky Business oil no no no no you know it's profitable and this
5:07
actually encourages the oil and social companies to go on after new wells and
5:13
reservations even though they might be thinking they can't even open them
5:19
because it adds the value
5:24
the assets on the balance sheet and it's just the formula done by
5:31
someone and used by many so I what are we doing today we are
5:39
dwelling in economics it's economic stupid as said
5:45
and this time the mirror is showing to us economics economists
5:51
what is the power of economic models and decision making and Society at Large
5:58
whom do we listen who counts what counts
6:05
and what would we need to do together to chase the models
6:10
man-made woman changed [Applause]
6:22
and how indeed because I do believe in economics this approximation of the
6:28
economy could really serve us as human beings and societies
6:34
so wholeheartedly welcome please join now please join with your comments and
6:40
questions and keep on coming together with us in this network also in the
6:47
future [Applause]
7:00
then to start with um we do not have on on Place
7:07
Paulo again diloni who is the European commissioner for economy and actually
7:13
could have had very good intervention and maybe comments on this but while he
7:18
couldn't be present he has a video recording for us and then after that we directly moved to
7:27
uh on petit four very happy to have you with us and to to hear your interviews
7:34
please the candy learning
7:39
dear chair honorable members distinguished guests let me first thank the organizers for
7:47
this cross-party initiative Keynes once wrote that the ideas of
7:53
economists and political philosophers are more powerful than is commonly
8:00
understood indeed he wrote the world is ruled by
8:06
little else so this session on the power of economic models is definitely appropriate
8:14
I think we can all agree that an Economy based on an ever
8:19
increasing use of limited resources that produces even
8:26
more waste and Emissions is not a sustainable model
8:31
nor can a model that perpetuates inequalities be viable in the long run
8:38
understandably in recent years this satisfaction within economic systems
8:44
that increases disparities and threatens our planet has grown
8:50
and this discontent also extends to the way we measure progress or growth
8:57
notably GDP we all recognize that GDP as an
9:03
indicator has its limits indeed in the first article I published
9:09
as commissioner even before the pandemic hit I called for a new sustainable growth
9:15
strategy and for integrating a broader set of indicators into our assessment of
9:22
how member states are performing but I want to be clear that the
9:28
alternative to a traditional growth model cannot be a d-growth model
9:35
a shrinking economy will have fewer not more resources to invest in
9:42
Environmental Protection in healthcare education infrastructure and the likes
9:49
economic growth remains an essential engine for positive change
9:56
that is why the shift in Paradigm that the commission has embraced is towards
10:02
sustainable growth that does not come at the expense of the environment nor at the expense of the
10:10
weakest in our societies this paradigm shift is what the European
10:16
green deal is all about it's about transforming the European economy and moving to a different growth
10:24
model one powered by carbon free electricity and Renewables
10:29
and based on circularity principles reuse and recycling
10:35
it's about lifting our growth and making sure that the fruits of that growth are
10:42
shared more widely also by investing in new and more advanced skills
10:49
our approach to sustainable growth is a holistic one for example
10:54
the European semester our cycle of Economic Policy coordination focuses on
11:01
the economic environmental and social dimensions of sustainability
11:07
the same approach has guided our economic response to the pandemic and to Russia's war of
11:15
aggression against Ukraine first with Next Generation EU and then
11:21
with repower EU and there is widespread support for it
11:27
over 80 percent of citizens agree that the EU should invest massively in
11:34
renewable energies and increasing the Energy Efficiency of buildings transport
11:40
and goods according to the lightest EU barometer survey
11:46
at the same time many citizens are concerned about the cost of the
11:51
transition a worry compounded by high inflation and
11:57
record Energy prices in the wake of Russia's full-scale Invasion last year
12:05
and this is where evidence-based policy design comes in
12:11
the commission uses a range of economic models to assess and compare policy
12:17
option and their distributional effects our models look at the impact of
12:24
regulations and Emissions pricing and the benefits of using the revenues to
12:30
ease the social impact of the transition or boost Green Technology
12:36
but further efforts are needed to be able to quantify the impacts of economic
12:42
activity on all natural assets and the consequences of their degradation for
12:49
the economic possibilities of our children and grandchildren
12:54
EU level there has been a lot of progress in this field for instance eurostat has
13:02
developed several new indicators that measure what matters
13:08
such as CO2 emissions and income inequality
13:14
every year eurostat publishes a report on how each member states is performing
13:20
on the achievement of the sustainable development goals and the commission has been working on
13:27
integrating these new indicators as well as the sdgs into the European
13:33
semester and this July the EU will for the first
13:38
time present a voluntary review on the implementation of the 2030 agenda at the
13:45
high-level political Forum in New York ladies and gentlemen building an economy
13:51
that works for the people and the planet is a formidable challenge
13:57
but one we cannot shy away from integrated environmental and economic
14:04
models can guide us in this difficult task and the regular dialogue with all the
14:11
stakeholders involved is essential so I am confident that together we can
14:18
successfully shift to a new model of growth that is both sustained and
14:24
sustainable and so that economic growth can indeed
14:31
must be a force for good thank you
14:38
[Music] okay
14:46
here we heard the uh message by our commissioner for economy
14:52
and what do you think uh shall we raise the bar
14:58
[Applause]
15:04
and it is my great pleasure to give the floor to unpity for director of prime
15:11
policy research in macroeconomics place the floor is yours
15:17
[Applause] so I want to begin is everybody has by
15:25
thanking Philippe Lambert and his team and the 20 MEPS that have made this
15:30
possible uh we you know we're so impressed by the level of the organization and the care
15:36
that you've taken over this [Applause]
15:47
but I also understand this is probably not as popular that I want to say thank you to president Ursula from The Lion
15:54
for the generosity of her hosting this event of the commission hosting this
16:00
event [Applause] I've only heard criticisms of her speech
16:07
but I thought her speech was an incredibly important one and we on the green side of the political Spectrum
16:13
need to be careful we don't have enough friends right that's our problem that's
16:19
what we have to fix [Applause]
16:26
we cannot we shouldn't uh you know alienate those people that are coming towards us
16:32
right so we've spent these days basking thank you
16:37
we've spent these days basking in consensus we all agree on the need for sufficiency not efficiency on Equity
16:45
especially for the south on well-being on regenerative and regenerative economy
16:52
the donut economy a circular economy we have agreed on all of that we feel very
16:58
happy with ourselves because we're all cheering each other up right there has been no discussion
17:06
of a strategy for challenging power [Applause]
17:18
so there are two sites of power that should concern us the first one is the fossil interest
17:25
and that's a site that we're already at we're at the Barry page in front of the fossil instrument and we're throwing
17:31
stones at them we're shouting at them we're Brewing at them right but there is another site of power and
17:38
that is the money interest and we are nowhere near it
17:45
so they have it to barricades against us they have protected themselves from any
17:51
Democratic accountability from democratic regulatory oversight they are
17:56
now behind the barriers and we are not even challenging them we're not even where the real power is and they have
18:03
something which is extraordinary it's like a giant tap
18:10
it's like a giant spigot or a gas pump at a petrol station
18:16
and that pumps out easy deregulated money and most of it is aimed at the fossil
18:24
interest so we need to switch off that big
18:31
spigot that enormous pump we have to switch it off because it's easy money which means it's deregulated credit and
18:39
it's out of control it is the thing that is fueling fossil fossil fuel investment
18:46
and greenhouse gas emissions secondly we need to focus on monetary
18:52
policy not fall into the Trap set by the money Interest Who want us to focus
18:59
exclusively on fiscal policy we need to challenge the power of the
19:05
money interest we need to understand the global economic model that they operate
19:11
we call it capitalism without breaks powered by infinite supplies of easy
19:18
money of credit but if there's another aspect to that model which is that it's export oriented
19:25
all of our economies in Europe are oriented towards the global economy
19:32
towards exports and the domestic economy at home is neglected
19:38
now who's engaged in the export a sector the one percent the big
19:44
corporations are the model of our economies is to do everything to suit
19:51
their interests right so what what it does is to boost the income of the one
19:56
percent that model but at the same time simultaneously it depresses the wages the incomes of the
20:04
99 percent now the rich the rich don't spend all
20:11
their money Elon Musk you know can buy the odd rocket to go into outer space but really
20:18
he doesn't know what to do with all his money and he doesn't spend it he doesn't use it to buy the things the economy
20:25
produces the poorer the 99 spend all of their income but in fact
20:31
their income is shrinking and you can see they struggled to pay
20:36
for a roof over their heads to pay for decent Health to pay for dentistry in my
20:42
country right to pay for their kids to go to university all of these things are
20:47
now becoming beyond their reach they can't they can't con they can't purchase
20:52
all that the economy produces so then we have this extraordinary thing
20:58
where they don't use their purchasing power to produce what is up to buy what
21:04
is produced the result is the opposite of what much green commentary is about
21:09
it's a crisis of overproduction on the one hand and under consumption on the
21:16
other and I I want to say this so far from purchasing power chasing too few goods
21:23
and services which is what the mainstream would like have I think we have too many goods and services
21:30
chasing two little purchasing power and you can see it on any High Street when
21:37
those pound shops come and you see all of those Chinese Goods dumped in shops we we have gluts we have surpluses we're
21:45
producing too much and this of course has a massive ecological impact but with an agreement we tend to focus
21:52
on consumption and we tend to focus in particular on the consumption of the 99
21:58
and we leave alone the one percent I want us to change that Focus
22:07
so the thing is that when people cannot afford to maintain their living centers to pay for a roof over their heads to
22:13
pay for Education whatever what do they do they borrow money and when firms
22:19
can't meet their sales targets what do they do they borrow money too and so we
22:25
have this crisis of overproduction huge amounts of debt and easy money
22:32
right and low incomes falling real incomes across the board in the United
22:38
States in Europe in China China is repressing incomes in exactly the same
22:44
way as the Germans have been doing since the heart's reforms right so this place we know that this mixture of
22:51
overproduction debt and falling incomes leads to Global financial crisis so the
22:57
question now becomes when is the next one that's all and if you can get the timing right you can make a lot of money
23:03
I'm never good at getting the timing right so what lesson does this provide for the
23:10
green movement we must stop attacking the 99 if you
23:16
like the majority the people who are actually suffering under this model this economic model they're turning to the
23:22
far right because his palangi argued you know what they can see is that the market the
23:29
market is stripping them of all that's important to them and so they're looking and they've been told that sorry the
23:35
government can't do anything because the market says that they must pay for this and they must pay for that and that the
23:42
price is up and so the market decides the price of grain the market decides the Invisible Hand and Mark decides the
23:49
price of oil and if the market fancy is speculating on the price of oil it so does and it makes us pay right and what
23:56
happens is the 99 say we want to be protected from this Market
24:02
and they turn to a strong man it's variably a strong man in Italy it's a strong woman please protect us from
24:09
these markets what is the left thing what is the progressive side of the spectrum saying what they're saying is
24:16
this is the model so we must we must stop attacking the 99
24:22
we must attack the one percent for excess production by way of excess easy
24:28
money as Philip said last night at our gathering this is a fight
24:34
this is a struggle This Is War and the challenge we face is this how do
24:41
we mobilize the 99 to fight this war to break down the barricades erected by the
24:48
one percent that's what I want to discuss instead of everything that we agree on
24:53
and the first step in my mind we can take is this shine a very bright light on the finance
25:00
sector on the one percent [Applause]
25:09
rapidly it's not rocket science I can tell you if I understand it you'll understand it
25:15
right represented by Wall Street Frankfort and
25:22
the city of London and that they would be nowhere without
25:28
the taxpayer-backed public infrastructure which supports their money making their their speculation
25:35
their capital gains right they need the central bank and the central bank is
25:41
only there because behind it are millions I don't know how many million taxpayers there are in Europe there's
25:46
only 30 million in Britain but without 30 million taxpayers paying their taxes every year every month every day they
25:54
wouldn't be the revenues that the finance sector gets from the bonds that it buys is collateral right this is
26:00
public infrastructure this is our money this is our power we have to recognize
26:06
that this is our power we have to recognize that government bonds
26:12
the debt you know the the right would have us believe is some kind of evil thing is
26:19
actually something that the finance act cannot wait to get its hands on there
26:24
was a crisis under the Clinton Administration when Clinton decided he was going to have a budget surplus that
26:30
left to that led to a shortage of bonds on Wall Street and and the private Wall
26:35
Street nearly collapsed under the strain because it needs that collateral to be the collateral it gets to act to
26:42
leverage additional money in the shadow banking sector Beyond Democratic regulation
26:49
so we need to understand that we have power and we have to take that power and we
26:54
have to use it to dismantle the power exercised by the one percent we need to
27:00
acknowledge and deploy the power that is embedded in our public tax-funded institutions
27:07
we need to mobilize public opinion and build political power I'm not impressed
27:13
with booing politicians who are here because they're elected to represent our communities our societies and our
27:19
governments they're doing their job right we have to mobilize those people
27:24
so we get different politicians and if we've got the wrong politicians that's our problem we've got to address it
27:34
[Applause] finally finally the thing we just
27:40
absolutely have to do is to blow up the Easy Money pipeline
27:45
thank you [Applause]
28:08
well I am users certainly blew it up and gave the whole uh audio say a really
28:17
strong spirit so thank you for for that next uh we will uh have a guy Giro
28:27
Professor director of research from cnrs and again he's
28:35
um from the video so zero welcome and now the floor is yours
28:42
thank you thank you thank you for the invitation I would like to thank as well Philip Roberts for this momentous event
28:48
and I'm beautiful for a very inspiring speech so I don't know whether you can see my slides
28:57
yes we do okay can you see them yeah okay good so next slide I'm going
29:04
to try first in the first part very quickly to explain to you how some models lead to wrong policies this would
29:11
be a little bit technical but please bear with me second parting is a bit more subtle wait a minute or first slide to flight slide
29:18
before second part I will try to explain how some assumptions in a very subtle way already encapsulate at least
29:25
implicitly some policies so we are prisoners of these assumptions and therefore we are prisoners of these
29:30
policies and if we don't change the assumptions themselves we won't be able to change the policies and I will go
29:36
back to how to blow up the the easy money pipeline that npt4 just described and third part I will try to show you
29:42
that there exists alternative models they are not perfect because there is no such thing as a perfect model but they
29:48
are much better than the mainstream models that are used by almost everybody on this planet today next slide
29:55
so first of all in 2016 there was a big you know big crisis within the
30:00
profession of macroeconomists where you had some people like Paul Romer who back then was the chief Economist of the
30:05
World Bank and who would receive his Noble award just a few years later who wrote a paper just saying you know
30:11
macroeconomic theory is no longer in science next slide
30:17
then you had also a paper by Olivia Blanchard he was then the chief Economist of the IMF and he said
30:22
essentially you know the assumptions that we use in our models are essentially profoundly at Earth's with
30:29
everything we know about reality and the way we calibrate our model is non-convincing
30:35
the normative implications of of our model are not convincing and our DSG
30:40
model which back then was the kind of you know the top of the frontier of the research in microeconomics our DSG
30:47
models are completely flowed next slide so here is administration of how this
30:52
works you have the the great the black curve is the GDP of Greece just before
30:59
the B crisis of the Greek depth public debt and the curse around the the trajectory
31:07
are the forecast of the Troika that is of the IMF the European commission and
31:12
the ECB and as you can see each here the trigger was deeply wrong just
31:18
anticipating that the Greek GDP would go back to its previous value and each year the decb and the and you
31:26
know the European commission the IMF could not even learn from its past mistakes why because they use models
31:33
which are a technobium and so if you use an equilibrium model of course you will say well there is a small problem and so
31:39
small extraordinary shock but don't worry the Greek GDP will go back to its previous value which is supposedly
31:44
allegedly is equilibrium value and the consequence of that is that after that of course you can impose a
31:51
very harsh austerity program because you believe that no matter what the great GDP will go back to Instagram
31:58
what is completely wrong here is the very idea that our economies needed equilibrium the truth is that it's not
32:04
and that we need out of equilibrium margins next slide
32:10
here is another example of big mistakes that we make when we try to forecast so the rate curve is the price of iron
32:17
at the word level which is probably the most important commodity today in the world economy and the the colored lines
32:25
or the forecasts of the International Energy agency in Paris and as you can
32:30
see again each year the iea is deeply wrong in its forecast why because most
32:36
often the iea just expects that the price of oil will follow the linear
32:42
extension of its past and so what we see here is that not only are our economies not at equilibule but the Dynamics of
32:49
our economy is not linear even in the short run we cannot just expect that tomorrow will
32:54
be the linear expense extension of yesterday we have to think about the non-linear dynamics of our economies
33:01
next slide here is another example which is also
33:07
very very Troublesome the the rate curve is the level of inflation and the core I
33:13
mean the CPI for the US uh during and after the the global financial crisis of
33:18
2007 and the blue curve is the quantity of money created by the Federal Reserve
33:24
so that's the the pipeline of easy money that npt4 was alluding to earlier and as
33:30
you can see you have the different phases of the quantitative easing project number one then QE queued and
33:37
ue3 meaning that the Central Bank in the U.S has created billions and billions of
33:42
money just to save the banks and then many people would would argue that this would have led to a huge inflation and
33:49
the rate curve is just a level of Crisis showing that there was no inflation at all so the Mantra of a number of models
33:56
which says that if you just print money this will create inflation it's just wrong we have a counter example here and
34:03
if this is wrong this means that we have to change completely our models because 99.9 of the models used by making
34:11
situations like the IMF to ECB the World Bank Etc just assume that if you
34:17
increase the quantity of money circulating in the economy you will just have inflation and we know this is just not true this means that we need models
34:25
that can cooperate the true impact of printing money next slide
34:31
here this is another example which is um the the rate curve is the public debt
34:36
of the U.S before during and after the great financial crisis the global financial crisis as you see obviously the U.S debt
34:44
has increased tremendously and yet the blue curve is the spread that is a
34:49
measure of the riskiness of the public debt of the U.S assessed by financial markets and as you may know and this was
34:57
alluded to by npt4 earlier the balance the treasury bonds are used as collaterals pretty much everywhere
35:02
within the financial sphere so the price of U.S treasury bonds is absolutely key for the entire planet and as you can see
35:10
the riskiness of the public debt as it has been assessed by financial markets has shrunk has reduced during the same
35:17
period instead of saying oh the public test is increasing therefore it's more dangerous to purchase public debt in the
35:23
U.S the financial markets have said oh no no no the situation is very risky so let's let's go back to what is secure
35:30
which is U.S treasure balance and so our models when they claim that more public
35:35
debt means more riskiness means High interest rate for instance paid by the state they are just wrong next slide
35:43
so now I'm going back to climate when we try as economists to couple microeconomics and climate then we have
35:50
to face a big problem which is how to assess the impact of global warming and for that purpose we use what we what is
35:56
called the damage function probably the most famous damage function is the one introduced by Miller mean
36:01
adults who got the noble award and it's the blue curve here in this graph so the
36:07
x-axis is the increase of temperature and the y-axis is the fraction of the
36:12
world GDP that would be lost if we were to experience this increase of temperature according to be no doubts
36:19
damage function if we had an increase of global warming let's say at the end of the century of plus six degrees Celsius
36:24
then we would experience only a loss of 10 percent of the world real GDP which
36:31
honestly is completely ludicrous and yet you have many people many economists and
36:37
many also politicians following Bill not us and saying well you know global warming is not that dangerous because it
36:44
will lead at Mass to minus 10 of the word GDP which is not you know the end of the of History fortunately there are
36:51
alternatives the one by weitzmann and the one by dietzenstern which claim respectively that plus six degrees will
36:57
lead to minus fifty percent of the world GDP and the other one minus 90 and of
37:03
course whether you believe that these instead are right or no doubt is right you will end up with completely
37:09
different conclusions and you will of course uh advise a completely different public policies next slide
37:18
another point which is also absolutely key is why did we economists not
37:23
understand the key role played by energy in our economy if we have a power blackout like in India or in Texas or
37:30
California then of course the entire economy is completely stopped but this you will never see in a model in an
37:36
economic mainstream model why because most of these models are built on the assumption that the role played by the
37:42
by the energy in our economy can be assets can be measured thanks to the
37:47
cost of energy in GDP this is the so-called cost share theorem and this
37:52
cost turns out to be lower as long as the price of energy is low for instance in the US it has only been something
37:58
like eight percent of the US GDP during a long period of time and therefore many
38:03
economists would argue during this period that well energy you know is not a big deal
38:08
because it costs only eight percent of the world to GDP and therefore if you lose it it's not a big deal which of
38:15
course is completely wrong so we have to understand the key role played by energy and of course by fossil fuels in the
38:21
Dynamics of our economy if we want just to be able to think about the transition towards renewable energies next slide
38:29
and the last point I want to mention uh immediately is the so-called uncovery
38:34
trade parity which is a famous theory used by mainstream models to try to understand the Dynamics of exchange
38:41
rates and here what you see it's a bit fuzzy it's me chaotic it's the distance
38:46
with respect to a theory would would forecast And The Descent between what
38:52
the theory would forecast and what you are empirically observe and as you see there is a big stance whatever being the
38:57
kind of currency that you in other words we have no way today within our mainstream economic models to
39:03
understand the Dynamics of exchange rates and then these raises to be questioned why do we have flexible
39:09
exchange rates if we don't understand how they move next slide
39:15
another point also very important is the role of money and this goes back to Anne's pipeline of easy money in most
39:23
military models there is simply no money why because money is assumed to be neutral in the sense that if you just
39:30
multiply by 2 the quantity of money circulating in the economy you just multiply by two the level of prices
39:35
according to these models and of course this is completely wrong it's not true and briefly speaking we know that that
39:41
money is non-neutral on top of that in most of these models there is no Bank why because most of these models like
39:48
the diamond diving model they simply assume that a bank is only a financial intermediary entity which borrows from
39:56
the left hand to the money that it lends from the the right hand of course this is not true in real life every day A
40:03
Bank creates money that's the job of a bank a private bank and so if we don't
40:08
understand this of course we cannot understand the role played by banks in our economy we cannot understand how to finance technological transition and we
40:15
cannot understand how the fragility of our banks just threatened today our
40:20
entire economy next slide so in reality money is not neutral the
40:27
money creation is endogenous and and money creation is not necessary inflationary and what is behind all
40:33
these is the main idea that in most of these mainstream models saving leads to
40:41
inflation sorry to investment and that's why most of these models would say we
40:47
have to take care of the capitalist or the wealthy people because they are saving money and this money that is
40:53
saved by them is used in order to finance investment this is again completely wrong we know today that it's
40:59
exactly the opposite investment Finance Savings in other words it's because there is a demand for commodities for
41:06
services and therefore because there are entrepreneurs who borrow money in order to finance investment that wealthy
41:12
people can save money not the other way and as long as we have the idea to postulate the action that savings leads
41:19
to investment this will lead to completely wrong public policies which will systematically favor the saviors I
41:26
mean those who can save money that is actually who are benefiting from the work that we are doing the investment
41:31
that we are doing our neighbor and our efforts so when we will the 99 we will
41:37
be completely neglected next slide so for instance the the excellent Russo
41:44
Institute which is a French Think Tank published a report two years ago showing that if you scrutinize the first 11
41:49
commercial banks of the Eurozone you will see that they have on the balance sheet a number of fossil fuel assets
41:58
which represent on average 95 percent of their equity in other words if tomorrow
42:03
morning we were to be very bored and we decided that fossil fuels are strength assets then all of these banks will be
42:09
bankrupt and therefore they can threaten today politicians by saying oh you want to go
42:15
too fast in the direction of the ecological transition if you do that we are going to go bankrupt and you will
42:21
have to save us and we all know that Master States just cannot say a big Mega systemic Banks and therefore that's one
42:29
of the reasons and I believe that's the main reason why we go so slowly in the direction of the transition of the
42:35
English conversation that we need to put into practice and therefore if we want to win the war that Anna was alluding to
42:42
we definitely need to find a way to get rid of the fossil fuel assets which are
42:48
on the balance sheet of the banks next slide so I will go directly to the next slide
42:55
because time is running uh second part it's more subtle so I will go very fast next slide
43:02
there is there is an academic debate about the short run Phillips curve this Phillips curve says that
43:08
um the the increase of pay of wages is a function of unemployment if there is a
43:15
lot of unemployment it's much easier for employers to refuse to increase wages
43:20
because they will tell you well you know if you are not if you are unhappy with you your payroll today I mean there are
43:26
many people who want to take your job and so for almost 30 years today there
43:31
is a big academic battle against the short-term shielded groups where you have a number of microeconomies claiming
43:37
that it simply does not exist in reality if you scrutinize the data you will see that it exists and the reason I believe
43:44
that we have this debate it's because it's a way to hide the fact that we have
43:50
made the choice of unemployment 30 years ago in Europe by saying that inflation was the big
43:57
enemy we have implicitly said we want to favor unemployment but in order for this not
44:02
to be completely obvious we at the same time we also said oh you know there is no relationship between wages inflation
44:09
and unemployment this is just you know an old fairy tale from the Canadians in the whole time doesn't longer it does no
44:15
longer exist today and in reality we have made the choice of unemployment which is a very badly
44:21
public policy choice but we have hidden it behind a wrong uh Theory and behind
44:27
Role Models next slide another point also is inequality of
44:33
course so this is a very famous curve you know it's the elephant curve so I will go back immediately to the next
44:39
slide which is Bronco millenovich very famous girl which tells you that if you look at the the the growth of wealth in
44:47
the past 20 or 25 years or so essentially those who are at the Trump
44:52
of the um the elephant that is the the far right the one percent they have benefited a lot but also you know some
45:00
people would say well you know look at the head of the elephant and so it's not so bad for the middle class it's not so
45:05
bad also for the poor so this was essentially the message conveyed by by Bronco milanovic now it happens that
45:12
with a bunch of other economists next slide who have redone the calculations
45:17
with the same data I mean slightly different data sorry and they have ended up with another animal which is the Loch
45:23
Ness monster completely different and therefore if you believe that they are right the conclusion is completely
45:30
different everybody has been screwed up by the globalization of the last 30 years except one percent
45:36
there is no such thing as you know part of the middle class has also benefited from globalization and of course if you
45:43
believe that we should use data in the way it is they have been used by Bronco minanovic you will end up with a certain
45:49
type of macro policy or public policy while if you believe that the certain group of economists is right then you
45:56
will end up with completely different public policy and you will say well we definitely have to redistribute wealth from the richest wealthiest to the
46:03
poorest next slide so also a number of very technical
46:08
questions but I think they are key there are debates amounts should we use the national income or the GDP so at first
46:14
glance you would say well that's a you know a Byzantine problem actually it's not because GDP is based on the idea
46:21
that investment field feeds savings while the national income category is
46:26
based on the idea that savings feed uh investment and so you see that behind
46:32
this apparently innocuous methodological debate there is a huge political question which is should we favor the
46:39
wealthiest who can accumulate one thanks to our labor or should we favor those who worked and create value
46:45
another point is is capital labor elasticity of substitution positive bigger than one smaller than one the
46:51
truth is most probably between zero and one but this also has a huge consequence in terms of to be punished if you
46:58
believe that it's bigger than one you will say you know it's very easy to substitute Capital to labor and
47:03
therefore label should just should just adjust to to machineries Ai and all this and
47:11
therefore you may say you know you have no alternative but you have to just adapt to the situation because otherwise we will replace your brain machines
47:17
which is not true actually if you understand that chapter labor elasticity of substitution is below third gas
47:25
Capital exists the question of the answer is no this is no debate from the 770s uh the Cambridge controversy and if
47:32
you understand this you will understand that we definitely need to understand our economy as being based on several
47:38
identities you know industrial Capital Financial Capital um Social Capital etc etc Technologies
47:46
[Music] sorry I need to rush you up because we
47:52
we run out of the time so good okay can you give me just one minute to conclude
47:57
yes yes please so so if you can just go to the last slides
48:03
um not the last the one before the last there are a number of alternatives to these to these very wrong models
48:09
um which are based essentially on the Assumption of stop flow consistency that is you say well we know that an economy
48:15
is not an art equilibrium we know that the Dynamics should not be linear is not linear and we should just take care of
48:21
the fact that stocks today are just the the output of the dynamic stuff the
48:27
trajectories in the past if you keep all this in mind and if you base your model
48:32
on material flow analysis that is you say well energy matters matter matters
48:37
Money Matters then you can end up with much better models we are constructing them today at Georgetown University with
48:43
a number of other colleagues from the entire planet and I hope that they one day will replace the very bad models that are used today in order to Foster
48:50
very wrong public policies thank you easy
49:05
a big handful for you guys uh I think that this uh critical thinking about
49:13
economics should be taught to all kids Bubbles and girls just uh after they've
49:20
learned to read and write so best access to your uh teaching uh in the verse but
49:28
let's move because of the time limits on our next speaker Valentina bossetti
49:34
Professor from bakuni University please
49:43
okay I want first of all to thank the organizer this is possibly the most Rock
49:49
concert type Comforts I've ever been so that's why we academic are kind of uh
49:55
you know shaky because we're not used to this uh second I want to uh sort of
50:01
build on what has been said in the previous presentation and try to be a little more uh optimistic I trained as
50:10
an environmental scientist then I thought I would not matter in the world so I trained as an economist then I
50:16
realized economists would never accept him accept me so I did a PhD in mathematics so now they can accept me
50:24
and I'm a modeler so what I build our models and I don't care and I don't know
50:29
I have a part and I'm okay with many economics models I take whatever works
50:35
with other components though I'm not married to any by Constitution I'm not
50:41
married to any discipline and and so I don't hate economics I think economics has very good things to teach us so uh
50:49
what are these models that I've been working on and actually are there since the 70s and so much work
50:56
has come out of these models and then been you know known because it's part of
51:03
the ipcc I guess all of you know what the ipcc is then the working group 3 lives with mitigations with mitigation
51:11
the models in working group threes are not climate models those are economic models with additional components the
51:18
beauty of these models is that they are called integration models they within this name you have so many different
51:26
types from General equilibrium to uh you know partially equilibrium two System
51:32
Dynamics model two simulation models two non-linear models everything goes
51:37
because the problem is important it's not not a single mother that we should marry but it's the best my best model
51:45
for the specific problem that I have at hand and the thing that we we've done as
51:51
a discipline is to start to work with many models many groups and then sit together and say okay I have this
51:56
assumption you have this different assumption let's try to mimic the same problem and let's debate about the
52:04
differences in our results that's the way we build a community which is you
52:10
know which is the community I'm part of and the community the results of which you see in the ipcc so I want to tell
52:16
you three things about this community the first I want you to say a few few more things about these models the
52:23
second I want to show you some of the results that come out of this model and the third is a surprise so what these
52:29
models otherwise you sleep what is models are these models are you know
52:35
some more of them the fact that they are integrated means that they together with the economy
52:41
economic activities they also model the consequences for the environment it
52:46
could be the water the oceans it could be the air the atmosphere it could be the land and the biosphere or it could
52:53
be biodiversity the idea is that these adverse elements are you know brought
53:00
together in the same in the same system in the Same by the same but a group of
53:05
people that work together and the idea is that the feedbacks may go in both directions so economic activities might
53:12
have effect on the environment but the truth is also for the opposite direction
53:18
so we want to understand what a changed environment might imply for our
53:23
productivity labor productivity Capital productivity infrastructure reliability
53:30
Etc so these models were born in the 70s and then for a long time they were mostly
53:36
funded in parts of Europe and the us but
53:41
then um you know more recently Europe has really been pushing a lot of money into
53:47
the creation of these models with the second important ancillary benefit is
53:53
pushing also for our community to involve National modeling teams why
53:59
because every a government likes to have a model that has been you know built by
54:06
their own people I I it seems crazy but the same thing is happening for climate
54:12
science models each country when they have to have their own they don't want to be told what is going to happen to
54:18
the climate by other by U.S models by European models each country wants to
54:23
have their own so those are not my slides my slides are
54:30
only you know yes these are my slides so but it's okay I mean you can enjoy what reading both so the it's a very
54:37
beautiful graphic but I didn't do that so so what are what are the you know so
54:44
first of all I want us to be proud of the fact that the the Europe has really
54:49
been funding this community these models that as then spread across the planet
54:57
and really uh created a community that is now a global Community the second is
55:03
that the results coming from this model have really been meaningful for policy making an example is here what you see
55:11
you see in this ipcc figure is something as important as the time we should reach
55:19
net zero Mission okay to be able to reach a specific climate goal for
55:25
example if you move to the left of the graph you have more stringent climate goal if you move to the right you have
55:30
luster in your climate goals now who's producing those scenarios many many scenarios that are used to define the
55:37
timing of NetZero are these models okay so it matters that incorporate the
55:43
economy our activities our productivity what we produce and the emissions that
55:49
those activity produce and it also model how we can change economic activities
55:54
how we can change the way we will produce energy to reduce our emissions
56:00
the second set the results they produce is this beautiful rainbow graphs where we can see or imagine
56:08
future way our Energy System might work if we have different climate objective
56:14
objectives in mind so to the comment made before that you know forecasts tend
56:21
to be wrong when you actually get to the time for for when the forecast was made
56:27
I want to tell you this it's very hard to be a modeler and project for 2030-2050 okay you can be wrong in so
56:35
many ways but the point is that by producing these graphs you start to ask yourself a question a big important
56:41
question we realized was a big important problem we realized was that by postponing mitigation and for example
56:49
believing that we would do more negative emissions later we were putting at risk
56:54
the biodiversity and the force of the planet so some of the trade-offs can
57:00
only appear if you do runs maybe they are wrong but maybe but still they might
57:06
show you a trade-off that is there and real and important to take into account in your policy making
57:12
so what was the third thing that I wanted to tell you morals are not just important because of
57:19
the results they produce sometimes these results are wrong as I said the importance of mothers that when you
57:25
start to work together economists with people exporting air pollution with
57:31
people that are expert in biodiversity you start to create a new language that
57:37
is the language that you need to create a narrative a story the story is as
57:44
important as the result because the story helps you explain the Civil Society the the policy makers what are
57:52
the problems and the narrative The Narrative can only come out from this very different very interdisciplinary
57:59
discourse and I think that's the most beautiful part of this that's why I I
58:05
would not support also the rage against um
58:10
what was the name Bill nor Dallas why is everybody so upset he is the first
58:16
economy who cared he got the damage function completely wrong he actually is
58:22
very unfair to show the 2013 paper because he has papers that came out many many years and the 2023 for example
58:30
paper is a completely different story but he tried to speak with climatologists what is the first
58:36
Economist who sat down with climatologists and tried to think okay can we do something about that he maybe
58:44
it certainly did came we did come out with wrong magic at the beginning but
58:49
the problem is that policemakers want to have a single damage function and there's going to be heat how can you believe that there is a matter that will
58:57
produce numbers that are actually exact models are there to look at the future
59:02
to study to explore and ask questions they are not there to give you the thing so his answer was wrong too bad he
59:10
started to ask the right questions and I think that's important and that should be recognized
59:15
[Applause]
59:21
foreign [Applause]
59:31
Tina for making it very clear but not easier and economics always
59:39
aren't that but that helps us to to move on the path last but not least
59:46
Robert constanza Professor from University College London the floor is
59:52
your a great grand knowledge person in environmental social and economics field
1:00:00
so we are very happy and pleased to have you here thank you
1:00:06
[Applause] thank you Serpa and thank you to the organizers and this is an amazing
1:00:12
Gathering it's been called in a previous session the the Woodstock of Beyond growth
1:00:17
so [Applause] um I'm not an economist by training my
1:00:23
background is in systems ecology looking at at the whole system but during my PhD
1:00:29
they wanted me to take a a language and I convinced them to let me take economics instead so I took economics as
1:00:37
a foreign language thank you [Music] [Laughter]
1:00:43
and I think I got enough of it to get inoculated but not quite enough to get the uh the full disease
1:00:49
so where are we
1:00:55
I had some slides
1:01:01
sorry uh no no
1:01:13
okay oh here we go
1:01:18
great so um what comes Beyond growth I think I
1:01:24
would argue that it's sustainable well-being that's really what we're after and and how do we create that
1:01:31
sustainable well-being I think it it requires these three basic elements
1:01:36
first of all we have to have an adequate vision of how the world is our scientific understanding we heard about
1:01:42
the planetary boundaries work there's been a lot of work recently in human psychology what actually does contribute
1:01:49
to human well-being I think we're learning a lot more about how the world actually does work our scientific
1:01:56
understanding I think it needs to be much more integrated though to help us understand how this whole complex
1:02:04
interdependent system functions but beyond that I think we also need to have
1:02:09
an adequate vision of how we would like the world to be what are our goals for the future and I think we built and we
1:02:16
need to build a truly shared and Broad broadly shared consensus and on that on
1:02:22
those shared goals I think that's one of the missing elements here I think we all in this room
1:02:27
um I think share uh some of the goals about what sustainable well-being is but
1:02:32
I think the challenge is how do we broaden that that uh that Vision how do
1:02:37
we bring the rest of or at least 30 percent of the the planet which is said
1:02:43
to be the Tipping Point to allow these changes to happen how do we bring them on board I think one way to do that is
1:02:49
to elaborate what that world would look like what what kind of world would that be what would it be like to live in that
1:02:56
world why would it be better than than the world and much much better than the world that we have now or in the world
1:03:02
that we're headed toward this session though is about modeling so
1:03:07
what sort of tools and Analysis do we need in order to achieve the those goals
1:03:13
and I think we need much more systems thinking and modeling because we do live in a complex adaptive system as we've
1:03:20
heard from many previous speakers and and that's the kinds of approach I
1:03:25
think that we need and the conventional economic models are not looking at the whole system and finally I think we need
1:03:32
implementation strategies that are based on new kinds of Institutions that can
1:03:37
really deal with the commons are common assets and not just our private private
1:03:43
assets and I and I'll argue
1:03:49
including things like common asset trust which I'll talk a little bit about if we have time but but I also think we're
1:03:55
going to need societal therapy because I think our fundamental problem is that we're addicted to the current system
1:04:01
we're locked into this this system that we have now [Applause] [Music]
1:04:08
and you know it's it's we've been saying the same things that we've been we've heard in this room uh you know for
1:04:14
decades now but why haven't we made more progress and so it's it's clear that you
1:04:20
know simply confronting addicts with their problem and the solutions is often counterproductive we need a more nuanced
1:04:27
and a more positive kind of therapy which I'll talk a little bit about if we'll get through that in the end
1:04:34
um before we start talking about models um I'll just remind you of this famous quote if you uh that that all models are
1:04:42
wrong but some models are useful some models are more wrong than others that's true
1:04:47
but all models are wrong even the models that we have in our heads you know the way we think about the world they're at
1:04:54
least incomplete and they're just abstract and incomplete representations of a comp very complex reality so we
1:05:01
have to approach this all with a lot more humility often than we uh than we than we tend to and recognize that the
1:05:07
limitations of any abstract representation of reality but also look
1:05:13
for the those representations that are useful the ones that that really do help us to achieve are our shared goals that
1:05:20
we've articulated another way of saying this is the the fallacy of misplaced
1:05:25
concreteness we confuse the model with reality we confuse the map you know with the territory we get so married to our
1:05:33
models are ways of thinking of the world and our World Views that we can't we
1:05:38
can't differentiate them from what from the more complex reality
1:05:43
um this is a little more complicated but one of my first
1:05:50
interactions with economists was reading this paper by Herman Daly back in 1968
1:05:58
he wrote a very elegant paper titled you know on economics as a life science
1:06:04
and I think that's that's part of the problem that economics should be a life science not not physics and chemistry
1:06:12
but one that looks at the whole planet and the complex interactions among among
1:06:17
the different parts this diagram just shows the sort of conventional economic approach to
1:06:23
modeling the the uh the market economy sort of an input output model at the center but what Herman uh said that well
1:06:31
we need to expand those boundaries out to the boundaries of the planet and say you know uh it's the the economy really
1:06:37
is everything on the planet because it's all interconnected it all contributes to
1:06:43
our well-being in in some way or another so that was an early attempt to begin to
1:06:49
create this much more integrated approach to modeling that that planet but just to go back a little bit um
1:06:57
what's what's the current Vision or model of the macro economy this is a
1:07:02
simple caricature of that which shows the sort of conventional uh you know
1:07:07
factors of production land labor and capital but um assuming that these factors are
1:07:14
infinitely substitutable and they they come together in the economic production process and produce GDP goods and
1:07:22
services marketed goods and services these are things that occur in the private Market or exchanged for money
1:07:28
then they're either consumed or reinvested to make more Capital to go
1:07:33
into the future and and that our utility or welfare is is mainly if not solely a
1:07:40
function of how much we consume did I get water
1:07:52
okay we know this model is wrong how useful is it
1:07:58
well it's it's got some very uh serious underlying premises you know that more
1:08:03
is always better uh that and that there's nothing in this model uh that would prevent it uh from growing forever
1:08:10
so this idea of infinite economic growth has has sort of underlined a lot of economic policies built on this sort of
1:08:18
uh simplified vision of how the economy works it also implies that you know
1:08:24
private property is really the best way to go because we're talking about goods and services that are that are private
1:08:30
kinds of goods and services privatizable non-rival and excludable and so why
1:08:38
would you not try to privatize everything and nature is really a sideshow in this
1:08:44
model because you know we can substitute labor and capital for for natural resources and and the environment and
1:08:52
continue to grow the economy indefinitely Okay so hmm
1:08:57
what's a more uh a better model for the new world for the anthropocene that
1:09:02
we've heard about before for the full world that we now live in we have to recognize that we live in a materially
1:09:08
closed Earth system something everything has to go somewhere we cannot have you know material growth of the economic
1:09:15
subsystem on a finite Planet indefinitely that's just not going to happen it has to recognize that these
1:09:22
four basic types of assets the conventional built Capital individual
1:09:28
people human capital are interactions with each other our communities our governance our institutions our social
1:09:34
capital and our natural Capital everything else in the world that we didn't have to produce are all required
1:09:40
to produce conventional goods and services and but also to produce a whole range of other inputs and contributions
1:09:47
to human well-being that are not that are not marketed and should not be marketed so
1:09:55
and that the um these are not substitutable assets or at least not very not very far so they're all
1:10:03
required in some more balanced way in order to to uh to produce these services optimally
1:10:09
um so how do we model this system in more quantitative ways like the integrated assessment models that
1:10:16
Valentina was talking about uh well there's a there's a range there's a whole spectrum of different kinds of
1:10:23
models of the economy that have been done so far this is a a um a plot from a
1:10:29
paper that Dan O'Neill who you heard from yesterday uh and and his co-author
1:10:34
uh produced and they've done a survey an assessment of all the ecological macro
1:10:40
economic models that are out there the ones that do try to incorporate not just
1:10:46
the the market economy but the rest of the system into this um and they fall into a couple of
1:10:52
categories some are the sort of expanded input output models some that include
1:10:57
physical inputs and outputs but I think the the ones I want to emphasize are the
1:11:02
systems Dynamics models the ones that actually do look at the way stocks and
1:11:08
flows in the system change over time and how we understand that the complex
1:11:14
feedbacks in those systems and and how they uh how they how they affect all of
1:11:19
the things that are important to us including our sustainable well-being now you've who's ever who who's read
1:11:27
this book the limits to growth in this audience that's a pretty that's a pretty good
1:11:33
fraction you know in 1970 came out in 1972 I think it sold what uh 10 million or more
1:11:40
copies so who who would have thought that a book about a systems Dynamics
1:11:45
model of the planet you know would sell that many copies but this is actually what it what it looks like uh if you
1:11:52
break it down into this Stella sort of simulation modeling language so it includes you
1:11:59
know a range of different variables I think on the order of 40 or so but but
1:12:04
it also looks at how those things change over time and they were quite ambitious in trying to build a model that started
1:12:11
in 1900 and ran all the way through uh 2100 you know two two centuries like who
1:12:19
had ever done that before in 1972 nobody was was even close uh to to producing
1:12:24
that kind of integrated Dynamic assessment of how this Global you know
1:12:30
global system work they were way out there in front of front of everyone else
1:12:35
of course it was it was lambasted particularly by the economics profession
1:12:41
because it didn't have prices you know they were predicting a collapse you know they were not showing that the economy
1:12:48
could grow forever essentially so it must have been wrong in fact these are
1:12:55
the um comparison between the projections of that model and what actually happened so it you know made
1:13:01
projections in 1972 out to 2100 and it was predicting that you know in in about
1:13:06
2030 where they were this is the business as usual scenario the other important thing about this is that this
1:13:13
was not the only scenario that they produced they produced the whole range of scenarios including ones that showed
1:13:19
how we could stabilize the system how would we create a steady state economy and the kinds of changes that we could
1:13:26
have made you know back much earlier that that would have gotten us to a place of sustainable well-being
1:13:34
you know about about now so um to carry on with that tradition this
1:13:41
is the 50th Anniversary plus one of the uh the limits to growth model
1:13:47
um by the club of Rome and uh in the fifth for the 50th Anniversary this this model was not just updated but but sort
1:13:55
of recreated and expanded and and built built on uh to create the uh this this
1:14:01
new model which you can download and take a look at and and play with on your
1:14:07
uh you know on your laptops going forward so that tradition goes on
1:14:13
some of the differences uh in the in the new version are that they included uh
1:14:19
well-being explicitly as a variable in the in the model and they included a whole range of other of other factors
1:14:26
again you know this is not a complete picture of everything that's going on in
1:14:31
the in the in the world but that is the the essential art of of modeling how do
1:14:37
you produce a a representation an abstract representation of the system
1:14:42
that that is useful that's useful in terms of trying to understand this
1:14:48
complex system trying to make projections uh into the future about about how things might might occur and
1:14:54
to do that it gets complicated but not so complicated that you can't begin to understand that particularly if
1:15:02
you can go and go in and play with the model yourself um one other model that I'll that I'll
1:15:07
mention is this one by Peter Victor and and Tim Jackson is actually working on a
1:15:13
a newer version of this uh what's called the low grow model and this was a model
1:15:19
of the Canadian economy which was explicitly built um sort of as a as a macro economic
1:15:26
model or as as close to that as possible but including many of the other factors that that were necessary
1:15:33
and they were able to show that you know if you just shut off GDP that you would
1:15:39
you could produce a no growth disaster but with the appropriate policy changes you could also produce a low or no
1:15:46
growth version of the Canadian economy that could go off into into city-state
1:15:52
so gee it's essentially an existence proof that you do not need even in a
1:15:58
complex economy like Canada you don't have to have GDP growth to have a a
1:16:04
viable economic system that produces all of the benefits that we've been talking
1:16:10
about so um just we remind you though that all
1:16:16
models are wrong but I think some of these systems Dynamics kinds of models ones that can actually incorporate the
1:16:24
complexity and of the of the the whole system and we're certainly getting much better at doing that as we learn more
1:16:30
about how that system functions and if we have evidence we have much better data going forward about how how it
1:16:36
works um we we can begin to create models that that really are useful to help us get to
1:16:43
our our goal our final goal of a sustainable well-being future
1:16:49
what sort of indicators do we need to attach to these models because I think that the uh that's the other connection
1:16:57
especially with this with this conference uh that these models can
1:17:02
produce can be connected with different indicators of well-being and I think one
1:17:08
of the the reasons that GDP has been so resilient to change is that it has this
1:17:14
underlying system of national accounts uh you know behind it what we need I
1:17:20
think going forward is a much more comprehensive System Dynamics model to
1:17:26
complement complement and replace that static system of accounts one that has
1:17:31
uh you know the the appropriate set of indicators built into it so that we can
1:17:36
look at not only how those things changed in the past where they are in the future but how they might change I
1:17:42
mean where they are in the present but also how they might change into the future under different policy
1:17:47
constraints um we also need I think we're at at the
1:17:53
point now as we've said in in one of our previous sessions that there's been enough experimentation with different
1:18:00
indicators of well-being and sustainability that that we can now get
1:18:06
to the point of building a broad consensus on what those what those appropriate indicators are uh so I think
1:18:13
that's that's the challenge that we're facing uh at the moment and I think connecting that uh with a better System
1:18:20
Dynamics understanding of the system will also help we can also employ a much broader range
1:18:25
of data sources than we have ever in the past and I think the integrated assessment models have started to do
1:18:31
that but we don't we don't have to be stuck with the kinds of data that we know how to collect what we really
1:18:38
should do is start to figure out what do we want to measure and figure out ways that that we might be able to go forward
1:18:44
and to measure that so but what's holding us back you know to
1:18:52
create this sustainable well-being economy uh what what what do we have to do and I would argue that fundamentally
1:19:00
we have to break our addiction to this growth at all costs economic Paradigm to
1:19:05
fossil fuels to over consumption in high income countries to all of the things that are keeping that are reinforcing in
1:19:13
the system uh and that and that are hard to uh hard to break out of uh you know
1:19:18
we've been as I said um making these same assessments and proposing the same solutions for decades
1:19:24
but we haven't haven't made much progress uh in in overcoming this addiction that means it's going to take some kind
1:19:32
of therapy and it turns out that you know what uh what works at the individual scale to overcome addictions
1:19:39
is not confronting addicts with their uh with their problems that's often
1:19:44
counterproductive it's but one therapy that works is is based on establishing
1:19:50
uh the life goals of the individual what kind of Life do they want to achieve and
1:19:56
using that to help motivate the kinds of the difficult changes that are necessary to
1:20:03
overcome addictions and I think it's the same process that we could use at the societal scale how do we create that
1:20:11
shared vision of where we all want to go I don't think we've spent enough time
1:20:16
and effort you know trying to do that and I think we there are some some unique challenges to doing that but
1:20:22
there are also some unique opportunities out there uh you know with with the internet ability to communicate with
1:20:29
everyone on Earth you know the sustainable development goals are clearly a step in that direction of
1:20:35
creating a global shared Vision but I think we could do much more than that and and ultimately I think it's going to
1:20:42
take a movement to order in order to implement that vision once we have that shared Vision once it
1:20:49
becomes uh clear enough and that that's the kind of world that we want then I think that can help to motivate the
1:20:56
difficult political changes to overcome you know the fossil fuel Lobby to overcome many of the the kinds of
1:21:04
lock-in uh addictions that we we have in in society today
1:21:11
yeah interrupt you so but could you please wrap in one minute this is my
1:21:17
last slide I'll just put up some some recent books that go into more detail on all of this thank you
1:21:22
[Applause]
1:21:33
great thank you Bob for your presentation and one of the out of the
1:21:39
many important messages is what you had is that learn to measure what you want
1:21:45
and I would add there what you do not want not only what you've used to measure and what is available and and
1:21:52
easy and then of course one of my favorites is the system thinking and
1:21:57
modeling and another thing that everybody should learn after
1:22:02
adding and minus in in mathematics in in school
1:22:08
once again a great thanks to our panelists and one question that I would
1:22:14
like to ask you a quick comment because I think that we all here can agree that the the GDP is uh
1:22:23
not a good measure it is actually very perversive message if we look what it
1:22:30
actually delivers to to us as natural capital and human well-being
1:22:36
we can agree that there's a lot of data right already and measurements the only
1:22:43
point is how to get them on board to agree how to harmonize standardize them
1:22:51
and we can agree that there's quite a rush to do that we can't wait 100 years
1:22:58
it's more or less like five five years that we have the time
1:23:05
we agree that we need to change the economic modeling like uh guilevery
1:23:11
will and the rest of you have shown so my last question uh for all of you would
1:23:17
be what is then the role of universities science institutions and then the
1:23:24
politics so what do you think that the the science the knowledge people like
1:23:31
you could and should do to engage the Civil Society and politicians
1:23:37
because I can't do a remodeling of any kind
1:23:43
[Music] yes what needs to happen in regulatory level
1:23:50
to to facilitate this prose and and would you like to start
1:24:00
my head so I just want I think it's really important you'll I could I think I can
1:24:06
do with the last part of your question which is what is the role for politicians and I think the role for
1:24:12
politicians on the on our side of the spectrum so to speak is to understand our power you know and also think about
1:24:20
it as power because we have power but we it's unused you know Wall Street knows
1:24:25
how to use public infrastructure we don't know how to say sorry these are the terms and conditions
1:24:33
I personally wasn't against the bailout of the banks in 2008-9 what I was
1:24:38
against was that there was done unconditionally and the politicians have to lose their uh or if you like the the
1:24:47
way in which they sort of genuflect to the to the these financial institutions
1:24:52
and say sorry no you know we want terms and conditions for bailouts if you want
1:24:58
to use our assets if you want to use our resources public resources taxpayer back resource these are the terms and
1:25:04
conditions so we just like our politicians have a bit more spine or backbone if you like when God's dealing
1:25:11
with them [Applause]
1:25:18
thank you and Gail what would be your answer
1:25:23
So my answer would be twofold first regarding universities I would say what we need today is not a university but
1:25:29
the plural University that is a place where we really can have an open discussion about Alternatives so
1:25:38
so I definitely agree that bill not us has played a big role and that's absolutely beautiful but we definitely
1:25:44
also need today to have other voices showing that while the situation might be much more serious than he believed
1:25:50
during use so that would be the role of employable plural reversity as opposed to a university which is an inheritance
1:25:57
from the middle age and regarding regarding politicians I would go exactly in the same direction of Anne so let me
1:26:03
just give you an example if you haven't just do it as a politician that money is not neutral
1:26:08
and that there is money creation then you can think in the European system why
1:26:14
is the European Central Bank Independent from the political power so as a politician you should question
1:26:20
that and say well maybe this was a mistake you know the sacrosanct Independence of the Central Bank makes
1:26:26
no sense once we understand that money has an impact on fiscal policy and vice versa then you could also say why not
1:26:33
print your practice your QE for people or a qualitative easing for green Investments for a green New Deal at the
1:26:40
European level then you might even ask go as far as saying couldn't be on the
1:26:45
public debts which is hold at the balance shift of the ECB or even you could say could the ecd purchase some
1:26:53
fossil fuel assets on the balance sheet of commission Banks and play the role of the background because we know that
1:26:58
sooner or later people would suggest to create bad things that will do exactly the same job as they did in 2009 that is
1:27:05
to buy for essential assets in order to save our commission Banks from a disaster and then these are the big
1:27:12
questions that politicians could ask once they really have understood that money matters mathematics energy meters
1:27:22
thank you thank you guys and then to Valentina
1:27:29
what is your advice so I started teaching climate change economics 10 years ago and I had 10
1:27:37
students I am in a mainstream economics University now I have a plus 100 plus
1:27:42
and I have multiple courses and so I'm very optimistic about the new generation
1:27:48
I'm very pessimistic about the older generation last three years I haven't
1:27:54
experienced the private sector and I was uh you know I was shocked by the level
1:28:00
of knowledge that young Engineers have in in a big Energy company really they
1:28:06
know everything about climate change they you know they think about infrastructure by thinking ahead and
1:28:14
looking at climate projection so that wasn't the problem the problem is all the you know public people work in the
1:28:21
public sector policy makers Etc they are I come from Italy they are
1:28:26
very old so they didn't learn any any of these at school they have no idea zero
1:28:32
so I would I would talk about the two degree Target they have no idea of I mean they say to the criteria because
1:28:38
it's written but they have no idea what that means two percent to minus two minus two of what so complete ignorance
1:28:45
and and that I don't know how to change that in a country with very old people
1:28:50
in power that we the only way is that younger people vote them down but in my
1:28:55
country they don't
1:29:05
then all the young people and other activists you hear it plus then join the
1:29:11
parties the one that is closest to you or then some of the conservative parties
1:29:20
you know if all these 10 000 people that have been attending this conference
1:29:25
wood recruit five of their friends and then all over our member states
1:29:32
would take over the conservative parties
1:29:40
wow would I have friends
1:29:46
and actually the political structure is in that powerful and big when it comes to to membership
1:29:52
and if people really would take that hardship to come in to battle and debate
1:29:59
with the old guard and be voting on on party Congress is
1:30:05
about the programs and prime ministers and with whom you go to government or whatever
1:30:10
that makes the trick so please
1:30:16
then last but not least Robert back to you and your comments
1:30:24
well I think University universities have traditionally you know been the source of social change and I think it
1:30:31
can happen again but I think we also need to change the way we're we're
1:30:37
handling teaching in universities that we need much more engaged you know
1:30:42
education much more sort of problem focused and I think if we could have you know students and politicians and and
1:30:49
Business Leaders working together to solve problems rather than simply lecturing at students and telling them
1:30:55
what we already know you know how do we get them in the classroom working together with other stakeholders to to
1:31:02
discover new new Solutions and new new ways to go and also to change the uh you
1:31:07
know the the age and gender Dynamics in the in the classroom and the power power Dynamic so this whole idea of learning
1:31:14
by doing and you know problem-based learning I think we could do a lot more with that to to push this agenda forward
1:31:21
and it also I think is going to take it's going to take a movement it's going to take you know political change at
1:31:28
some level and that has to be driven by you know this Vision what what does this world look like and make it clear that
1:31:35
we're not talking about people sacrificing you know to get to this world we're talking about an improvement
1:31:40
in people's quality of life uh and in in many many ways and I think the the
1:31:46
psychological research sort of backs that up quite clearly uh you know that
1:31:51
but that is not known to most people most people think they have to continue to consume and and that's the only path
1:31:58
to happiness but it's obviously not thank you Robert
1:32:08
I see different kind of international hand signs from the organizers so unfortunately we do not have time for
1:32:15
questions from the audience but it's totally my fault not the panel and not
1:32:21
the organizers so I take it and very briefly a thousand thanks to to our
1:32:28
wonderful panelists and uh wonderful audience you made it thank you
1:32:34
[Applause]
1:32:48
so this is
1:28:50
