Beyond Growth 2023 : la décroissance est-elle la seule option pour sauver la planète ?


0:46
it's not every day that so many people
0:48
from all walks of life and across the
0:49
political Spectrum gather to discuss
0:51
such consequential economic change
0:55
most people attending the conference
0:56
believe that GDP growth is no longer the
0:59
best indicator for determining economic
1:01
policy
1:02
they want a more holistic approach that
1:04
incorporates among other things
1:06
sustainability circularity and general
1:08
well-being
1:10
it's an idea that's far away from
1:13
current mainstream thinking but not as
1:15
far as you might think
1:17
Rose model
1:19
centered on fossil fuels
1:22
fueled simply obsolete
1:25
[Applause]
1:27
[Music]
1:32
many in the room would like her to have
1:34
gone further with critics saying her
1:36
support for moving beyond just fossil
1:38
fuel growth is too narrow
1:42
but it's a start for a conference that
1:43
five years ago only had one commissioner
1:45
attending let alone the European
1:47
commission president herself
1:50
the hard work begins now though as
1:52
lawmakers and other stakeholders start
1:54
the difficult process of trying to turn
1:56
debate into policy and move Beyond
1:59
growth
2:00
[Music]
2:01
the big question though how to turn
2:03
these debates into policy how to change
2:07
a model that's been churning for years
2:09
to answer these questions I'm delighted
2:11
to be joined by French member of the
2:13
European Parliament and vice chair of
2:15
the greens EFA group very welcome
2:18
a social scientist and writer from
2:20
France
2:21
we're also joined by anuna De veva the
2:23
bad and climate activists the face of
2:25
the Friday for future movements here in
2:27
Belgium and we're also joined by Ludovic
2:29
the Confederate Secretary of the
2:31
European trade Union Confederation
2:34
great to see you all welcome to Euro
2:36
News thanks for being with us here and
2:38
bringing us a little bit inside this
2:39
conference it's my first question to you
2:42
is if economic growth is destroying the
2:44
planet why has it been driving the
2:46
European Union for decades should we
2:48
start with yourself yeah well um that's
2:51
a huge question and a good question
2:52
actually
2:53
what we've noticed now is that we're
2:56
over Crossing six out of nine planetary
2:58
boundaries so we speak a lot about
3:00
climate change but also but by the
3:02
diversity about toxic substances or
3:06
about water and we really need to act
3:08
and what did feed this overcrossing of
3:12
the planetary boundaries well is there
3:13
is for profits as you underlined in the
3:16
beginning this dog mouth growth that is
3:20
supposed to bring all the happiness in
3:22
the world it's supposed I mean that's
3:24
what we've been told for ages is
3:26
supposed to bring us a redistribution of
3:29
wealth so social equality it's also
3:31
supposed to bring us technologies that
3:33
would save the environment that we are
3:36
destroying and it's supposed to solve
3:38
all our problems that we have so
3:42
everyone is just running after growth
3:44
would it be private companies wanting to
3:47
just profits they need this growth and
3:50
political leaders that also pretend that
3:53
purchasing this growth is going to solve
3:55
all the all the issues that we have and
3:57
we can definitely see that this is not
3:59
working that we are over Crossing this
4:01
planetary boundaries putting at life the
4:03
survival of humanity and of many other
4:06
species indeed and not solving the
4:08
sociology factor from from etook there
4:10
and and how can you answer that question
4:12
and why has it been this business as
4:13
usual for so long
4:15
well the the role of Trade union in
4:18
history has always been to set the human
4:20
boundaries and to say what are the
4:23
rights of workers and to make sure and
4:25
it's still ongoing I think that now we
4:27
have also since decades the role to put
4:30
the planet boundaries and not to oppose
4:32
the planet under human boundaries that's
4:34
what we name just transition in the
4:36
Trade union movement it's we need to
4:39
plan a transition that is possible for
4:40
people so that they have quality jobs
4:42
that they have social protection that
4:44
this works and of course this goes
4:47
against the logic of Rapid profit and
4:50
that's what we have to change in society
4:52
is it possible
4:54
of course the big question that
4:56
everyone's asking you yeah it's actually
4:58
interesting to listen to because I think
4:59
there's a big generational thing here in
5:01
that a lot of the young people that have
5:03
met at this conference and myself I'm 21
5:05
years old we're not actually obsessed
5:07
with growth like we're just looking at
5:09
this concept now with Scientists hard
5:11
science with social sciences and we're
5:12
understanding that it's actually done
5:14
much more harm than good so for Our
5:16
Generation growth is something that we
5:18
are actually actively fighting and this
5:19
whole Paradigm of growth and this
5:21
obsession with growth in the European
5:23
Union is not something that we've been a
5:24
part of yet so what are you obsessed
5:26
with about purposes with well-being I
5:29
think and equality and understanding
5:31
that if we want to live in a society and
5:33
in a world that it where equality is is
5:35
a priority I think that D growth is a
5:37
very fundamental part of that and you
5:39
mentioned well-being well-being and
5:41
Innovative well-being of course that was
5:42
a big topic of the week's conference but
5:44
we'll talk about that a little bit later
5:46
let's just get the perspective from
5:47
yourself social scientists you've
5:49
written a lot of books on on various
5:50
topics that have been discussed this
5:52
week here in the European Parliament
5:54
what's your take on all this well for a
5:57
few decades we have believed that
5:59
somehow we could keep growing and
6:01
polluting less at the same time we call
6:03
it green growth we talked of of
6:04
decoupling the two but now like science
6:07
has shown us with hundreds of studies
6:10
that actually that decoupling is not
6:12
happening so right now we have this
6:15
obsession with GDP which is a 100 years
6:18
old indicator which is a bit strange
6:20
because it's completely decorated from
6:22
well-being in high-income countries but
6:24
we're also facing the insustainability
6:27
of the pursuit of growth so D growth
6:30
basically is a plan B of we've tried to
6:32
Green Grow that's not going to work now
6:34
I think that should be acknowledged as a
6:36
fact for the result of the last ipcc
6:39
report and so we do need to organize a
6:42
democratically planned downscaling of
6:44
production and consumption in high
6:46
income countries and organize it so that
6:49
it can be done in a way that is both
6:51
Equitable and convivial okay do you
6:54
think that this obsession with GDP is
6:57
killing the climate or killing the
6:58
planet excuse me look
7:00
yeah for sure I think that growth
7:02
objectives uh when we are discussing
7:05
growth objectives now it's quite clear
7:07
that growth is linked to more
7:09
productivity so it has also impact on
7:11
workers it has uh also impact on all uh
7:15
when politicians speaks about our growth
7:17
it's also activation of the unemployed
7:19
of the long-term uh sick uh those who
7:22
are sick so it's putting more pressure
7:24
and not speaking about what we should
7:26
really speak about it's what do we
7:27
produce uh how many people we need to
7:30
produce this uh how many hours we need
7:32
to work to do this so the intent behind
7:35
the discussion on postgrove Beyond Grove
7:38
or green growth I think what we really
7:40
have to focus on is what we want to
7:43
produce as a society do we produce
7:44
already enough do we share this uh is it
7:48
Equitable and can we share this properly
7:51
while giving people a hope that tomorrow
7:54
we will still have quality jobs so it
7:57
should not be at the expense of quality
7:59
jobs okay shouldn't be the expense of
8:01
quality jobs
8:02
okay Tucson do you think you can really
8:04
have growth for good or do you need to
8:06
start focusing on D growth
8:09
well I think that focusing on growth is
8:11
a mistake focusing on GDP is a mistake
8:13
and if we talk about the growth we
8:16
absolutely need to have a material deep
8:18
growth we need to have the growth of
8:20
emissions of greenhouse gases we need to
8:24
have a deep growth of consumption of a
8:27
lot of materials of production of toxic
8:30
products such as pfas or plastic that
8:33
are polluting everything destroying our
8:35
health political soils our water so we
8:39
need to go in that direction and really
8:41
wonder and that's what Elizabeth was was
8:44
saying we need to wonder what do we need
8:47
and how do we ensure that this is
8:49
created and the rest is okay and we just
8:52
managed to do something else with our
8:54
lives and this is this is working but
8:56
for this we really need to change the
8:58
focus because the European union now
8:59
with its policy on stability
9:03
budgetary stability is pushing to
9:06
destroy
9:08
um what is needed like social
9:10
infrastructures like investments in in
9:14
green reorientation green transition and
9:18
it's actually pushing also to liberalize
9:22
and financialize everything so that we
9:24
can ensure that still the the level of
9:27
the growth is growing and this is really
9:29
not the right direction
9:30
what would you say to that well I think
9:32
that it is about a fundamental
9:34
re-prioritizing what we find important
9:36
in society and I think for a long time
9:38
especially when Fridays for future
9:39
globally came on the streets a lot of
9:41
people said we need to keep ideology
9:43
away from hard science and politics but
9:46
the re the reality is that there is a
9:48
big ideology in the growth Paradigm
9:50
which is neoliberalism and that's what
9:52
we need to rethink right now and I think
9:54
not only D growth but also
9:55
decolonization is going to be
9:57
fundamental to systemically and
9:59
institutionally change that
10:01
okay well you're all very much on the
10:02
same side of the coin so we want to also
10:04
bring in a couple of other perspectives
10:06
as this was not just organized by one
10:08
political group this conference this
10:10
week in fact there was five political
10:11
groups on board and one of those groups
10:14
was the European People's Party the
10:15
Irish MEP Maria watch is part of that
10:18
political party now that political group
10:20
would not be in agreement with a lot of
10:21
the debates and ideas that were perhaps
10:24
put on the table this week but Maria
10:25
Walsh she slided off a little bit from
10:28
her party line and spoke to our
10:29
Christopher pictures for your news take
10:30
a listen to what she had to say a
10:33
sustainable economy is one that's fair
10:34
and balanced
10:36
a certain cohort of people cannot
10:38
continue to take while other people in a
10:42
majority of people in our European union
10:43
and worldwide are being left in the
10:46
poverty lines so we need to find balance
10:47
Maria Walsh there the Irish MEP speaking
10:51
to Christopher pictures a little bit
10:52
earlier this week expressing how you
10:54
need to find a balance that Timothy it's
10:56
always about finding a balance but how
10:57
can you it's about finding a balance the
11:00
problem here if we compare ecological
11:02
Footprints so all the natural resources
11:04
we're using and we compare this to
11:06
biocapacity which is the carrying
11:08
capacity of your ecosystems you see that
11:09
high income economies all of them are
11:12
just out of proportion and the only way
11:15
of getting back in proportion is to
11:17
reduce production and consumption and
11:19
when we talk about d-growth that lays
11:21
out radical implications because the
11:23
current system we have neoliberal
11:25
capitalism cannot degrow it's not in its
11:28
DNA it's not one of the function so that
11:31
means going past capitalism rethinking
11:33
the role of businesses phasing out
11:35
for-profit mentality rethinking the role
11:38
of consumerism and materialism at the
11:41
individual and sociological level this
11:43
means scrapping nationally accounting
11:45
GDP and everything else to measure
11:47
well-being so we're talking about a real
11:49
Paradigm Shift wow that is a real
11:52
paradigm shift that could take decades
11:54
to be implemented
11:55
I don't think so that's the thing when
11:57
we're talking about technological
11:59
solutions I'm like how long will it take
12:00
to invent hydrogen plane and replace
12:03
every fossil plane by an nitrogen plane
12:05
develop the pattern work on it excavate
12:08
the real plane Market it advertise it if
12:11
we decide right now to be like well
12:12
let's fly 50 less plane you can do it by
12:15
tomorrow but what about our viewers who
12:16
are watching today saying but that's not
12:18
realistic I mean I have to pay my bills
12:20
I can't even afford to survive till the
12:22
end of the month there's a cost of
12:23
living crisis in Europe I'm struggling
12:25
to survive I've got fit I've got lots of
12:27
kids at home to feed how do you
12:29
translate that into their life so that
12:31
this world can be a reality as well for
12:32
them yeah I think here we need also
12:35
concrete policies we need to discuss
12:37
about concrete policies and it's not
12:39
only about scientific evidence and
12:41
Technical technological evidence it's
12:44
about convincing people societies about
12:46
convincing people we can do this uh and
12:49
this in the Trade union movement we
12:51
asked then to do it through just
12:54
transition this means anticipation of
12:55
change anticipate anticipation of change
12:58
means that you can plan that you can
13:00
invest that you can finance that you can
13:02
insure to people that their uh their
13:05
voice are heard and that you invest in
13:07
the future but this uh cannot be done
13:10
from Monday to another but for that you
13:12
need enabling uh environment to do that
13:14
not to put the climate against the
13:16
people not to put the people against the
13:17
climate sure and just on convincing
13:19
people I mean people don't like to be
13:21
told what to do people hate being
13:23
preached at so how do you tell people in
13:26
a way that they will they will
13:28
understand what's at stake here what's
13:29
it take for the planet what's at stake
13:30
for the future what's at stake for the
13:31
future of their of their grandkids I
13:33
think it's about involving people
13:34
honestly and that's I think a big part
13:36
of the growth is that you have a
13:37
democratically planned
13:39
um d-growth so that means that you
13:41
involve people through people's assembly
13:42
citizens smds you open up these fora and
13:44
every time that they've done that in the
13:46
past you see that people are actually in
13:47
favor of these very Progressive policies
13:50
and I think that right now we're
13:52
producing and consuming a lot of crap
13:53
that people don't need and as we've
13:55
stated before I think in this conference
13:57
is that the political landscape is
13:58
somehow what democratic but the economic
14:01
landscape is not people cannot decide
14:04
how things are produced and consumed and
14:06
and where we get those messages what
14:08
does
14:09
um what the what are the the mainstream
14:11
narratives on production and consumption
14:13
and so I think involving people in those
14:14
narratives and rethinking with them is
14:16
actually very valuable and it is one of
14:18
the key key things that degrowth is uh
14:20
proposing which is not part of
14:22
capitalism right now where people don't
14:24
have a say quick reaction to that yeah
14:26
no what I believe is that focalization
14:29
on growth is also leading to give more
14:31
money to those who already have money
14:33
and that people are very tired of that
14:35
and in the last years we have the
14:38
concern growing for the environment and
14:41
neural liberalism as used the
14:44
environment to ensure that the money
14:46
would still and even more go to always
14:48
the same people so we can see that in
14:50
all actually sectors that we have it we
14:53
if we look at the industry well now with
14:56
the reform of the ETS people will have
14:58
to to pay a carbon tax whereas industry
15:01
still has free permits to go along until
15:04
2013 34. if we look at the fish and the
15:08
Fisheries the the quotas that were set
15:10
in place in order to protect
15:12
um the fish well now they are profiting
15:15
to the biggest boats the ones who are
15:17
destroying the resources but also
15:18
destroying the jobs of the local
15:20
fishermen and you can see that in all
15:22
Direct actions so also
15:24
because when we want to protect and to
15:27
come back to planetary boundaries it's
15:29
because of a question of Justice we want
15:31
to ensure Justice and equality all over
15:32
the globe so to go there we need to have
15:35
just policies or else it's the other way
15:38
around it's not working for the planet
15:39
it's not working for the people and just
15:41
are not working for the people one major
15:43
concern we've seen over the past couple
15:45
of years as well is the amount of
15:46
burnouts people are suffering from at
15:48
work you mentioned earlier and in the
15:50
waiver
15:51
um well-being that was a big topic this
15:53
week here at this event here in the
15:55
European Parliament what about a four
15:57
day week I would like to get your take
15:59
on a four day week is that something
16:00
that employers should take on is that
16:02
something that should be mandatory get
16:04
your take on that first Timothy
16:05
absolutely so mechanically if you want
16:07
to contract production and consumption
16:10
that means you know working hours will
16:11
reduce sharing working time is a very
16:15
good way of avoiding virtual
16:17
unemployment during their transition not
16:19
only very good way of just fighting
16:20
unemployment but also of restoring a
16:23
certain balance you know fighting this
16:25
burnout and let's not stop at the let's
16:28
not stop at the four day work week let's
16:30
actually completely re-center
16:33
productivity towards the liberation of
16:36
free time so over the years a
16:38
performance economy is one that managed
16:40
to shrink working time and that should
16:42
be a definition of success instead of
16:44
measuring GDP every year I want us to
16:46
measure how many minutes we can nap per
16:48
day while still satisfying the needs of
16:51
everyone within planetary boundaries The
16:53
Liberation of free time I like you I
16:54
like that I think I'll be quoting you on
16:56
that and just on a serious note burnout
16:59
um cost 1.6 billion euros was spent on
17:01
people here in Belgium suffering from
17:03
burnouts that's according to date I was
17:05
looking up here in Baton what's your
17:06
take I know this is a big topic for for
17:08
yourself at the uh clear the Trade union
17:10
movement as always steered the
17:12
discussion on reduction of working time
17:14
but it's also important that to
17:16
acknowledge we are in a moment where
17:18
people to pay their bills they want to
17:19
work more if they are have the positive
17:22
to work more they take it because they
17:24
have to pay their bills so it means that
17:26
to convince we also need really to put
17:29
in place policies that really show that
17:31
you will not lose money by reduction of
17:33
working time you will not have to work
17:35
more intensively by reduction of working
17:38
time the problem of all we discuss
17:40
working time is often that it's at the
17:42
expense of workers rights even if you
17:44
have less working hours it would be more
17:46
intense it would be maybe with lots of
17:49
wages so it's something that we have to
17:51
take into account and maybe also uh in a
17:54
context where we ask people to work more
17:56
on a career uh yeah maybe we have also
17:59
to not only discuss about the four days
18:01
a week but the uh how many hours we work
18:04
on a year if it's possible to have
18:06
additional holidays every five years if
18:09
you can work uh less years on the career
18:13
so working time as a whole has to be
18:15
discussed not only through the four days
18:17
a week but which is a important entry
18:19
point for people to to to see what it
18:21
can mean I know that yeah no I
18:24
completely agree with this and I think
18:26
that redistributing
18:28
um the the way that we work and what we
18:30
put our work in is super valuable and I
18:32
wrote down here earlier in the
18:33
conference was said that 90 of the labor
18:35
globally done for the production that we
18:37
do for the neolibric capitalistic
18:40
Paradigm is done by workers in the
18:42
global South and peasants and so I think
18:44
that even just from an inequality
18:46
perspective having to redistribute that
18:48
globally and deciding what are we going
18:49
to put labor in and what do we not and
18:51
what do we again prioritize well-being
18:53
wise is super valuable
18:56
well maybe just to complement that if we
18:59
were four days a week we also need to
19:01
have the social activity structure
19:03
education child care and stuff that that
19:06
goes together with it right so it's it's
19:08
indeed an entire change of society but
19:10
it's a welcome one and you as an MEP can
19:12
you ever disconnect
19:14
I'm trying to but you know it's a bit
19:16
different when you like when it's your
19:19
passion and your job to to save the
19:21
planet basically yeah I think it's very
19:24
tricky to to ever disconnect if you are
19:25
a journalist but now back to the
19:27
conference so as I said earlier 2 000
19:29
people were physically here in the
19:31
European Parliament this week I think
19:33
two that two thousand also joined online
19:34
but what happens next what will come out
19:37
of this conference do you think Timothy
19:38
will anything really change
19:40
I think first we realize that discourses
19:44
of green growth are just empty promises
19:47
so we have to completely rethink the
19:49
European green deal the sustainable
19:51
development goals the Paris agreement
19:53
and just acknowledge the scientific work
19:56
that has been done
19:57
showing that green growth is not going
19:59
to happen so we cannot afford to base
20:01
the survival of our species on magical
20:04
thinking so I do hope that once this
20:07
conference is over we can actually work
20:10
in rewriting a feasible strategy for
20:12
sustainability taking into account this
20:15
very important point which is the fact
20:17
that economic growth we've been having
20:19
in Europe for the last decades is not
20:21
the magical you know result of the
20:24
imagination of inventors it results from
20:26
the mass appropriation of energy soil
20:29
water and labor time from the global
20:32
South and so degrowth in already rich
20:34
countries is absolutely necessary to
20:37
liberate natural and human resources for
20:40
sustainable development in global South
20:42
okay
20:43
yeah so what's next for me it's uh I'm
20:47
going to Berlin by train we have our
20:48
Congress next week in uh in Berlin as
20:51
etuc and it will be also an important
20:53
moment to discuss these issues and we
20:56
have a whole chapter discussing the
20:57
account enemy where we say the economy
20:59
has to work for the people on the planet
21:00
so we have to find a way in order to uh
21:03
to have this massive investments in
21:06
people and in quality jobs uh while of
21:09
course these are investing in fossil
21:11
fuel subsidies and this will need a
21:14
change of course in the European green
21:16
deal also taking into account the social
21:18
consequence of the European green deal
21:21
so the climate objectives it's fine but
21:23
the social consequence of the climate
21:25
objectives they are completely
21:26
overlooked so it's important that in
21:28
2024 we also see the debate at National
21:32
level at European level during the
21:34
elections towards a real just transition
21:36
of the workforce that we can plan and
21:38
that we can convince people of okay same
21:40
question to you anona and also do you
21:42
also agree that you don't think the the
21:44
European green deal is fit for purpose
21:45
no absolutely not no because it is very
21:48
growth based so I do think that there's
21:49
going to be a lot that has to change
21:50
there and I think from an activist
21:52
perspective but we're going to be doing
21:54
also from the streets is really try and
21:56
build a movement of movements because
21:57
because I feel like the climate movement
21:59
needs to work with the workers rights
22:00
movement is to work with the
22:01
decolonization movement needs to work
22:03
with the degrowth movement because it is
22:05
so all encompassing right it is really a
22:07
paradigm shift so we need to build that
22:09
movement of movements we've been talking
22:10
about it for so long and it's really
22:11
starting to happen the fact that this
22:13
conference is being organized right now
22:15
and there's so many young people here
22:16
present means that it is going to be a
22:18
big future discussion and I think in
22:21
that there's a one fundamental question
22:22
that we need to ask ourselves is who are
22:24
we even growing this economy for if it
22:26
is a very elitist
22:28
um a few amount of people that can
22:31
accumulate all of the wealth right now
22:32
then that is not an economy growing
22:34
worth growing for anyways and perhaps
22:36
maybe industry the missing link as well
22:38
here they could perhaps come to the next
22:40
Beyond growth Conference Final word with
22:42
yourself or MEP around the table will
22:45
you be bringing these ideas into your
22:46
committee meetings will they be
22:48
translated into policies what would
22:49
really come out of this meeting well
22:51
there will be an after uh and as there
22:54
was a before
22:55
um and and this is a changing moment
22:57
first first of all we are opening the
22:59
European Parliament largely it has never
23:02
been opened like that before and we are
23:05
opening the door to citizens to discuss
23:07
but Beyond Grove so as itself it's a
23:11
historical event and then indeed we
23:13
managed to organize this conference with
23:15
MEPS from different political groups
23:17
with different stakeholders that are
23:19
coming here and this will be taken taken
23:23
up in the next discussions within the
23:25
European Parliament I don't have so much
23:27
hope that it changes the the political
23:30
landscape right now and we see the right
23:32
wing and and the Liberals going against
23:35
nature policies and social policies that
23:38
we are trying to set in place but for
23:40
the next terms definitely it's going to
23:42
change the discourse the way we see and
23:46
we deal with this very fundamental
23:48
issues so I I really think there will be
23:50
a before and after okay very good and
23:52
just a final word with yourself Timothy
23:54
were you impressed with what the
23:56
European commission president said when
23:59
she was at this event earlier this week
24:00
she did speak a little bit outside the
24:01
box I was not impressed at all I was
24:04
actually very surprised the European
24:06
green deal was 2019.
24:09
the situation has changed the situation
24:11
of ecosystem has changed and now we're
24:13
not on the course to get the feedback to
24:15
55. this is what science tell us this is
24:18
what the last ipcc tell us so I would
24:20
have expected a bit more critical
24:22
reflection on what has been done until
24:23
now and meeting like okay guys what
24:25
we've done has not been enough we want
24:28
to do something new and we're here to
24:30
determine what that thing is rather than
24:33
just
24:34
microwaving you know all recipes that
24:37
haven't worked okay
24:39
now we're going to
24:40
have thank you so much for being with us
24:42
thank you so much too thank you to our
24:44
favorite for being with us as well and
24:46
