Beyond Growth closing plenary â€“ Pathways from here: roadmap for a Green and Social Deal


 run last step
0:14
you've been quite energetic I mean it's seven hours a day of conference and then all the breaks seven hours a day of uh
0:21
being fed uh interesting stuff learning new ideas exchanging and all the rest of it and
0:28
you're still there and you don't even look tired I can't believe this I can't believe it
0:36
yeah so here's the plan we are going to try to
0:43
make this session uh Lively I was supposed to give an opening statement of eight minutes I won't do this I will
0:49
give you concluding statements at the end uh and we will go directly into a
0:55
six-person panel basically well what I would say is tell us uh what you want to
1:01
tell us we are at the end we are at the end of the conference so so for me it's
1:07
really free speech we try to give the the best of what we we had those last
1:12
three days and maybe we try to look forward we like to look forward because I don't believe that anyone here wants
1:20
this just to be okay a nice bracket in our life uh where we had good time
1:25
together and then life goes on no don't don't quote me
1:32
voila so let's get going uh I will go to my seats so I can introduce you the wonderful speakers we have and we have
1:39
had only wonderful speakers actually maybe with a few exceptions but okay I won't elaborate
1:46
[Applause] [Music] hello so we start
1:54
which team so team I read your book when was it actually Prosperity without credit 2009
2:01
okay and we are in 2023 that's the year I was elected in the European Parliament
2:06
really Swift came off the block yeah okay
2:12
um and I read Peter Victor also at that time uh so very interesting stuff but indeed you were part of our first
2:19
edition five years ago you came to this one uh well basically the floor is yours I don't need to introduce you I think to
2:25
this ground [Applause]
2:34
thank you thank you for inviting me here thank you to Philly this is an extraordinary event an extraordinary
2:40
closing of an extraordinary confidence and you don't need me to tell you this discussion doesn't happen here in the
2:46
hemisphere every day I know it's difficult to believe but it's true come Monday or perhaps even tomorrow this
2:53
space is at risk of being reclaimed by the Mantra of growth
3:01
[Applause] Philip's opposition to that has been legendary and he's engaged in that
3:07
struggle with a sense of calm purpose charismatic humanism and a very deep commitment this conference is a
3:13
testimony to that and the culmination of that commitment so thank you Philippe and your team for bringing us here
3:20
together again
3:26
foreign [Applause]
3:57
quieter place last night I was invited to a salon at Full Circle
4:03
just a few minutes down the road from here to speak on the theme imagining a post-growth economy the room was full
4:09
conversation was Lively the debate was invigorating and then right at the end a young woman asked me
4:16
what does a post-growth economy have to offer to a generation fearful for their future
4:24
a high school teacher emphasized the same point she'd lost sight he said to me of what to say to his kids when faced
4:32
with the same question and it struck me not for the first time there is no easy
4:37
answer to this question it's easy to see that anxiety is in part
4:43
a reflection of the deeply dysfunctional nature of our economic system it's in part a result of a kind of dream we have
4:50
tried to sell our kids sell ourselves a fantasy that it's always possible for
4:56
everyone always to have more and more that there are no limits to our aspirations for material progress that
5:03
technology can solve all our problems that the economy can expand forever
5:09
this is the myth of our time the myth of growth the Mantra that
5:14
guides our political thinking our economic science our sense of progress that more and more is always possible
5:22
and now and you don't need me to tell you this either that myth has become dangerously unraveled it's because the
5:30
climate in crisis an unprecedented loss of nature it's triggered Financial instability it's legitimized austerity
5:37
it has contributed to war it has been possible for the few only at the expense
5:43
of impoverishing many our Pursuits our obsessive pursuit of
5:48
economic growth has even blinded us to what mainstream economists now recognize
5:53
as a new normal a gradual decline in the growth rate not
5:59
just because of Ukraine not just because of covid not just a hangover from the financial crisis or the misplaced
6:06
austerity that attempted to fix it but a secular stagnation across the oecd
6:11
Nations that has been creeping up on us for decades this new world is one we are
6:19
totally unprepared for a place where conventional economics has no real answers a place where fairy tales of
6:27
Eternal economic growth as Greta tunberg called them are leading us not towards Paradise but towards disaster
6:35
of the dream that was our culture to paraphrase paraphrase something Kami
6:43
Claudel the sculptor once said this is the nightmare no wonder our kids
6:50
are terrified but their question remains how can imagining a post-growth world
6:58
help us here I believe it can help in three distinct ways it can turn the concept of limits
7:05
on its head it can focus our minds on core characteristics of a post-growth
7:12
economy and it can bring into focus more clearly than ever before the nature of the
7:18
struggle we now face let me say a little about each of these
7:24
things in the time I have today when the club of Rome published its limits to growth report back in 1972 economists
7:31
and politicians lined up to condemn it there's a famous quote from Ronald
7:37
Reagan there are no great limits to growth he said because there are no limits on the human capacity for
7:44
intelligence imagination and wonder shortly before the pandemic in January
7:50
2020 another remarkably insightful U.S president gave a speech in Davos
7:56
condemning climate activists young people with exactly the same anxieties
8:02
raised in the salon yesterday to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow he said we must reject the perennial
8:10
prophets of Doom and their predictions of Apocalypse they are The Heirs of
8:15
yesterday's foolish fortune tellers our hero gazed across the Savannah of
8:22
upturned faces towards the horizon of endless possibility Paradise is a land forged by a frontier
8:32
mentality burn it down dig it up build it over progress is a construction site
8:38
it may look messy for now but tomorrow's Condominiums and shopping malls will be a glorious sight let those who doubt
8:46
this Vision perish the school kids the climate activists the extinction Rebels they can all go to hell
8:53
this rejection of limits is a massive cultural blind spot the Relentless
8:59
pursuit of more blinds us to Human Nature
9:05
it prioritizes it institutionalizes voracious greed
9:12
but it neglects our deepest needs for belonging for connection for Community
9:18
for a sense of purpose and meaning it precipitates a casual
9:23
swipe right consumerism that promises the world but leaves us ultimately
9:29
endlessly unsatisfied characterizing Prosperity as the
9:36
Relentless accumulation of wealth is nothing more than a denial of our Humanity a denial of the interdependent
9:44
Web of Life on planet Earth a denial of death it appears to offer us consolation
9:52
but it cannot extinguish the anguish in our souls the longing for something
9:57
deeper now we're on difficult ground here if we
10:02
teach our kids there are no limits at all they will become disillusioned dysfunctional adults
10:09
but if we suggest that the world is a dark and foreboding prison full of
10:15
limits they will never achieve their full potential but retrenchment and denial are not the
10:23
only response to the reality of limits adaptation offers a far more creative
10:29
alternative human and Earthly limits properly understood
10:35
said the conservationist Wendell Berry are not confinements but rather
10:41
inducements to fullness of relationship and meaning beyond our material limits Beyond growth
10:49
he was suggesting lies another world a place worth visiting an investment worth
10:55
making beyond the limits to affluence lies an affluence that only limits can
11:01
reveal to us limits of the gateway to the Limitless
11:09
I believe this Insight is part of an answer to the anxiety expressed yesterday so eloquently a way of looking
11:16
at the world and being in the world that allows for realism but encourages aspiration
11:22
but to make progress on that Insight we need not only to challenge the rejection
11:27
of limits but to revisit the definition of prosperity to ask again and again
11:34
what can Prosperity possibly mean on a finite Planet if we are to replace the
11:42
narrow definition of prosperity as wealth with something meaningful I'd like to suggest there's a blindingly
11:49
obvious starting point the foundation for all our prosperity the foundation for all our wealth is
11:56
health health is one of the things people identify when you ask them about their priorities in life our own health
12:03
our families Health our communities Health our planet's health and this idea of prosperity is Health
12:10
guides us away from growth because health is not about having more and more
12:17
health is about balance it involves what Aristotle called a virtuous balance
12:24
between deficiency and excess it positions itself directly counter to the
12:30
myth of growth and something quite surprising follows from this to deliver Prosperity as
12:36
health we need an economy whose guiding principle is care
12:42
amongst the many excellent side events at this extraordinary conference was one that focused on the challenges of the
12:48
Care economy I spoke on the panel there and I promised to bring some of those ideas back into this plenary today in
12:55
fact my own argument was that it should have been a plenary event
13:01
in the first place the care and attention of one human being to another and to the conditions
13:08
of living lies at what Nancy fulbray called The Invisible heart of the
13:14
economy while Adam Smith's invisible hand is busy insisting that we're all selfish
13:20
consumers falbray pointed out that without care we are nothing our children would lead stunted lives
13:34
our children would lead stunted lives the sick would find no respite the dying
13:39
no Solace our societies are nothing our progress means nothing without care
13:45
there is no economy not even at the most basic level
13:51
the covid pandemic brought that home to us forcefully but its lessons are already slipping from our minds they
13:59
must not be allowed to the care economy is not just a sideshow in the search for
14:07
a post-growth world it is the blueprint for it
14:13
feminist economists have been making this argument for decades The Lion's Share of care work paid and unpaid is
14:19
done by women and quite possibly because of this care work has been denigrated in
14:24
modern society not accidentally not inadvertently but systematically
14:31
capitalism externalizes the burden of care in much the same way that it
14:37
externalizes nature by counting the wrong things by valuing the wrong things by focusing on narrow
14:44
death definitions of productivity that privilege profits over wages and working
14:50
conditions by rigging the rules of the game and by refusing to change
14:59
and this brings me to my third and final point
15:04
there is no doubt we are confronted with a profound dilemma perhaps the most
15:11
profound dilemma of our times growth is unsustainable
15:17
but the world Beyond growth is frightening we have built an economy that's
15:23
dependent on growth we must learn a new how Society works when the economy is
15:29
not growing how welfare systems work how Financial systems work how government works and we
15:36
need to confront the impossibility theorems presented to us by those who
15:42
resist change if you think you are looking at a dysfunctional
15:49
system that benefits no one then you are probably not looking hard
15:55
enough the fine words and supportive gestures of those who cling to power hide vested
16:03
interests intent on sabotaging progress and this is where
16:09
our allegiance to care must be tempered with realism
16:15
our compassion for each other toughened with an iron resolve our
16:22
infinite creativity grounded in a sense of struggle
16:29
to wake up each day to a sense of security and comfort
16:36
is a beguiling vision for our lives to wake up to a sense of struggle can
16:42
take our breath away and yet that struggle provides another kind of answer
16:49
to the challenging question posed to me last night by that young woman how can
16:56
a post-growth economy help a generation to face a future filled
17:04
with anxiety and doubt not through a rose-tinted sense of blind
17:11
hope not through a false promise of more and more
17:17
not by vague assurances that everything will be okay but through a commitment to struggle
17:26
the antidote to despair lies not in Hope but in action in agency in engaging with
17:34
all our Creative Energy in the task ahead a path through the limits towards
17:40
the Limitless a Prosperity based not on wealth but on health
17:45
a struggle to unravel the systematic Distortion of values that lies at the
17:52
core of a broken capitalism and to construct in its place an economy
17:58
of care and craft and creativity fit for purpose on a finite planet
18:05
and that is why I close as I began with my profound thanks to Philippe for his engagement in that struggle over so many
18:13
years now and in particular of course for bringing us all here today
18:21
thank you Philippe thank you [Applause]
18:41
thank you Tim [Applause] well you have a talent of bringing the

[Applause]
33:00
let's see Dominique
33:05
hello um
33:21
Esther you are leading the European trade Union Confederation and I remember
33:28
preparing the first conference five years ago of course we had a lot of support and the final event by the way
33:33
was in in the in the trade Union house but I I will never forget an internal
33:40
meeting where some trade unionists basically attacked me saying well you attack rules but you
33:46
know that we need grow for Social Security and so we cannot live without it and basically it was quite abrasive
33:51
actually uh I would say that well since five years things have uh as a strongly
33:58
evolved in in between us and now you are totally part of the game so the floor is
34:04
yours [Applause]
34:12
oh so so thanks Philippe and congratulations on what I'm told is the
34:18
Woodstock of Beyond growth so uh so congratulations again on that and I want
34:25
to begin by thanking you for inviting us because it's no small thing to invite trade unions
34:32
um uh we represent the e2c represents 50 million workers and their trade unions
34:38
and I want to begin by thanking all the trade unionists out there who are the front line of the struggle
34:45
for a fair and just economy [Applause]
34:52
and you're right Philip is this is a difficult discussion for us because we've a lot of skin in the game
34:59
so I want to be very honest in in how I'm approaching this discussion as many
35:05
of you know I hardly ever read from a speech but I have one in front of me because I've talked very carefully about
35:11
what I want to say so like many of you trade unions are and
35:17
have been raising concerns about the use of GDP or GMP as a measure of well-being
35:23
of Nations the most obvious problem I don't need to tell anybody in this audience is that they're simply not
35:29
designed to measure well-being so they don't work for that purpose
35:35
we also agree with many of you here that tweaking at the edges of existing
35:42
models will not be sufficient to address the economic societal and environmental
35:48
Transformations that are needed New Alternatives are now required
35:54
and we have one key message but we would really like to get through for the final outcomes
36:02
and that is that social dialogue and the involvement of workers and their trade
36:08
unions is essential for a successful transition to a Beyond growth economy
36:17
[Applause] as my colleagues in industrial who I
36:23
know had an opportunity to take the floor already say any nothing about us without us so uh so
36:32
so so just to acknowledge industrial strong campaign for a just transition
36:39
been advancing ecologically sustainable and socially Progressive alternatives
36:46
we stand with them in urgent need of a renewed sense of shared prosperity and a
36:52
commitment to fairness and flourishing in a finite world that's why I want to focus on the world
36:59
of work workers and their wages we see that there's a need to reset the
37:07
balance the Beyond growth economy has to address the correct balance
37:15
we can't import all of the problems of unfairness in terms of work and its
37:22
remuneration into a Beyond growth economy right now living standards are falling
37:28
across Europe there's just two responses on the table more wage restraint and more pressure on
37:36
working people through higher interest rates or Worse what we see coming is a too
37:44
fast debt reduction requirement it's going to be discussed in this house I'm
37:49
going to be discussed in this house the next couple of days and the call to struggle must must in the EU recognize
37:56
that if we don't get the rules right everything we want to build for a Beyond
38:02
growth economy Public Services all of that will become impossible so we need
38:08
to make sure that we're not hampered by a set of rules that will set us backwards that's why the etuc is going
38:15
to be a key part and wants to work with all of you in ensuring that those rules are what we need to have both to secure
38:23
effective social services but also the Investments for the green transition both of those key to a Beyond growth
38:30
economy we accept that the growth imperative has
38:36
shaped the architecture of the modern economy the European semester is rooted
38:42
in the growth Paradigm take for example the constraints of Germany's debt break
38:47
a constitutional provision that limits the structural budget deficit 2.35
38:53
percent of GDP now when it was suspended in the face of the economic challenges
38:58
following covid-19 and the war in Ukraine then there was successful
39:04
measures put in place to protect jobs and incomes so the success that was achieved for
39:10
working people and their communities was achieved despite the fiscal rules not
39:15
because of them that's why the etuc is again calling for
39:21
an amendment of the fiscal rules so that we promote green Investments we
39:26
recognize the importance of of social spending both to well-being of the economy but also to competitiveness
39:33
their discussion about having a competitiveness check has taken hold in the EU
39:40
now you can't have a competitive economy unless you have Social Services Workers
39:46
aren't widgets when they come to work they need to have child care they need to have transport
39:51
they need to have affordable housing they need to have training they need to have a place where they can can live and
39:58
work so our message is very clear there can be no return to austerity
40:05
[Applause]
40:10
[Applause] now because I was told it's going to be
40:15
a lot for economists I said to the office I need some figures so so they said look the figure you can
40:23
use that because because we've just done some research is how much are wages
40:28
increasing compared to how much Dividends are increasing they said that that tells a very clear story of of
40:35
exactly as you say who has the power
40:41
so so in 2022 Europe's largest firms paid out record-breaking dividends of
40:48
230 billion in dividends and dividends increased by 14 percent
40:57
whereas wages only increased by four percent so I asked you who is driving inflation
41:04
it's not working people [Applause]
41:15
now tackling prices also needs to be part of the solution because those
41:21
companies were ripping off workers but they were also ripping off consumers too so we need to pay a lot more attention
41:27
on how much prices are and why the prices are that so we're calling for a
41:33
lot more attention and a lot more tools to be able to tackle excess profits and
41:38
key to that has to be taxation when it's it's not it's not right that somebody has enough money to go to the
41:45
moon for the weekend and pay so little tax like that's something fundamentally fundamentally wrong and we need a lot
41:52
more taxes so finally then yes
42:00
I'm on Unapologetic about it workers need pay increases they need pay increases to be able to put food on the
42:06
table put a roof over their head and to have a future that they and their families can believe in it needs to be
42:13
secure work it needs to be quality jobs at the heart of that is putting putting
42:19
power back into the hands of working people so that they can be active agents in their own success and how do we do
42:27
that we do that by making sure they can join a union without fear and collectively bargain Recent research in
42:34
America also demonstrated that in the real world when you get out of the theoretical models in the real world
42:39
High minimum wages not only do they not have any negative impact on employment
42:44
they actually had a substantial Improvement in terms of the number of
42:49
jobs in America so I think that reevaluating the value of work and I know that Adam also also
42:57
raised this we need to look at the value we subscribe to different jobs
43:04
because so much of it is bundled up in flat out discrimination I'm thinking of caring but I'm also
43:10
thinking of cleaning what the covid crisis showed us that they're not low-skilled no skilled jobs
43:16
they're highly skilled jobs life and death jobs and yet we poll don't pay them so very little
43:22
and there's no justification for look for low wages for for anybody anywhere
43:29
there are also needs [Applause]
43:35
I'm nearly finished I promise so there also needs to be in their Beyond growth economy and I'm
43:40
sure it would have come up by and particularly taken up by the feminists in the in the group and as everybody
43:46
knows I'm I'm a lifelong feminist but there needs to be a lot more done in relation to unpaid work that that
43:56
we can't look forward to a Beyond growth economy [Applause]
44:02
unless we have a plan to to address that for real for serious
44:07
then finally the the other point I'd like to be included in the um final conclusions is that we really need
44:15
investment for a successful green transition we we here we leave no one
44:20
behind we need no region behind but we're still short on the plans that make that a real a real a real Prospect so
44:27
there can be no blank checks anymore all resources or supports that go to Industry need to come with conditions
44:34
social conditions and that has to be avoiding redundancies or deteriorating in working conditions it has to be about
44:41
reskilling the creation of high quality jobs and where this sector is is a
44:46
sunset industry then there needs to be a genuine alternative in that Community available and we have to and what and we
44:54
have to have that as a real plan we also need to have a right to training so much
45:00
of what's been offered for the future for working people in terms of making the transition is to say well you need
45:06
to get retraining but no they can get the time off or they can't afford to get to the course so there's no bus to even bring them to the course on that day so
45:13
we need to have real plans that give effect to the principles that we're setting out
45:19
so I want to thank you again I want to congratulate Philip I I want to give a
45:24
commitment that the Trade union movement is here with you on this journey how we go about making the change is important
45:31
which is why it's so important to involve workers and their trade unions in at all levels and in all ways we have
45:38
our Congress in Berlin next week this is one of the key items on our agenda so I
45:44
look forward to staying in touch for you being part of our struggle for um and for us being part of your struggle too
45:51
and for us making sure that the economic laws that will be adopted by the end of this year do what they need to do to to
45:57
support a Beyond growth economy thank you [Applause]
46:09
[Applause]
46:16
thank you Esther well I can tell you that my co-president Terry reinker will be with you in Berlin
46:23
uh next weekend and uh it is a testament to the alliance we see between uh
46:29
between us and the trade unions I think that instead of criticizing trade unions
46:34
for uh not being enough representative politicians would be well inspired to and to encourage unionization because
46:42
indeed if we want democracy we need checks and balances if we want economic democracy we need counterpower to
46:50
economic power and I know of all no other from the trade unions to do that this is what needs to happen and indeed
46:59
and indeed there's only one point uh on which I will disagree with you I think austerity has to come back
47:06
as to come back in Davos this is the place where we need austerity this is
47:12
really where we need it
47:17
indeed when you when you mentioned the uh the horrifying I have no other word
47:23
uh numbers of share buy bikes dividend distributions I mean in in this world is
47:30
this still possible I mean we what people need to understand that
47:36
well they are not alone on this planet and if if this place is sometimes a bubble I imagine I can only imagine
47:42
because I never went to Davos but I can imagine that Davos is even more of a
47:47
bubble let's burst this bubble [Applause]
47:56
my impression is that if I look back the last 30 some years
48:01
economic policy in Europe has been pretty much dictated by Germany
48:09
and and to be honest and to be honest what a good surprise it has been to
48:16
discover at all sides the zoo Institute founded by Germans so who says that
48:24
nothing good can come out of Germany Jacob the floor is yours
48:30
[Applause]
48:37
and thank you thank you very much Philippe for that yes
48:42
uh thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak in front of this amazing audience that makes me very humbled
48:49
if you were in this room yesterday around five you would have heard that
48:54
frankly quite terrifying intervention by John rockstrom on the latest news on planetary boundaries
49:02
you know we are really not on track where we need to be it's quite the opposite and I think it's really no
49:07
wonder that we are in this situation because you can still earn a lot of money burning fossil fuels or
49:14
overfishing our oceans and at the same time you can also still earn a lot of money exploiting workers and make a
49:21
profit from that and then take those profits and put them to tax Havens to maximize them even more
49:27
so we are still incentivizing behavior that essentially leads us to where we are right now and I think that's the
49:33
conversation that we have to have now we've talked a lot about social and ecological goals and I think to really
49:39
achieve that we need to speak about how do we create economies very concretely here in the EU in which you cannot win
49:46
anymore if you exploit workers overshoe planetary boundaries but in which you win if you do actual good for people and
49:54
the planet [Applause]
50:01
and with the Zoe Institute we have been working very closely with the Parliament and the commission and the council and
50:06
we're trying to come up with very concrete Pathways forward that bring us there and I want to share three concrete
50:14
Pathways that get us on track to such an economy and the first thing is we need to shift
50:21
the priorities in economic policy making towards what's needed in the 21st century economy to really work
50:27
for the last century the economy has been get around creating wealth and making the pie bigger and bigger and
50:34
always bigger and with the focus on GDP you know we were really successful in that we created a very big pie
50:40
the challenge for the 21st century is to redistribute that pie and make sure that we're avoiding ecological breakdown so
50:48
we have to prioritize that in economic policy making and I say economic policy
50:54
making deliberately not only because I'm a German economist but you know because with the Paris
51:00
agreement the EU green deal and the youth commitment to Net Zero by 2050 the general direction of travel is clear I
51:08
think and we also have some great Frameworks you know that tell us something about where we need to be in terms of Social and ecological goals
51:14
like donut economics but it's a little less clear still is how the economy exactly needs to look like to really
51:19
deliver that so in addition to what we have we believe we need a new North Star for
51:27
actually that is irritating my slides look very different ah okay find those out slides
51:35
I will deal with that let's see um so in addition to that we need a new North Star for economic policy making to
51:41
guide us that tells us if the economy is actually ready you know to deliver those social and ecological priorities and
51:48
that's all we have worked on that in the past for a while and the new Northstar that I want to offer you today is
51:54
economic resilience and the idea here really is that instead of focusing on making the pie even
52:01
bigger until we cannot reach anymore you know we can create economies that
52:07
thrive in Balance like Tim said it before you can imagine a young branch of
52:13
a tree you know and when there are strong winds it bends a little further away but it goes back to its original
52:18
state and our economies can be like that we
52:23
can create economies that are able to handle change and transition really well while still thriving and maintaining the
52:30
actual core functions which are in our eyes at least you know providing us with decent jobs decent quality of life and
52:36
room to thrive and all that within planetary boundaries so I'm offering you this new North Star
52:43
to guide economic policy making exactly directly to these priorities and what
52:48
you can see on that slide is how well EU countries are already doing a comparison based on an index that we have developed
52:55
at Zoe and then we have to make sure that these economic social and ecological priorities are
53:02
actually prioritized it's not enough to just set goals we also really have to deliver them so dear European policy
53:10
makers and politicians here is what you can very concretely do to start shifting
53:16
priorities the first thing is we need to influence all the layers of
53:22
policy making we have to make sure that we unlock all the places where GDP is
53:28
logged in we need to talk about the narratives we need to look at the technical level
53:33
at the level of where the indicators are and we need to look at the governance level that describes how the indicators
53:40
are actually translated into concrete policies and then we need to make sure that alternative future fit indicators
53:46
are implemented so you really got to start using them you know in Impact Assessments in monitoring and evaluation
53:51
and a budgetary allocation mechanisms and then when we did that when we have
53:56
integrated them in actual policy making those new indicators we still have to make sure you know that those new
54:02
priorities really happen because you know we all know how politics goes so we need a safeguard
54:08
and I think a potentially very interesting safeguards is what they have
54:14
in Wales in Wales they have a future Generations commissioner
54:19
and if you don't know that person you should look her up because she's
54:24
really awesome she's really fantastic because of that person in Wales they will not build any new roads for the
54:31
next 30 years because she essentially said you know that's going to lock us into technology that's bad for future generations and they're going to build
54:38
bike lanes and public transport infrastructure and said how awesome is that
54:48
and in the past days we have discussed quite a range of proposal how such a safeguard could look like at the U level
54:54
one idea that came up was a committee for Beyond growth Futures in the European Parliament that can be
55:00
introduced right now to work on the priorities for the next commission another thing would be a directorate
55:06
general for sustainability and well-being in the commission or how about like in Wales we have a vice
55:12
president for the well-being of future Generations in the next European Commission
55:20
[Applause] so there are many concrete Pathways
55:27
forward for the EU to prioritize social and ecological goals the point is there are multiple options there are no excuses so let's get it done right now
55:36
and then I hate to break it to you but I'm an economist and we need to talk about money
55:42
and let me check if I have oh wow my new slides are there wow how did you mention that I'm very impressed
55:49
thank you very much um okay cool
55:54
we need to talk about money and we need a lot of it we are talking post World
56:00
War scale here for the green transformation according to you estimates we need an additional
56:05
Investments of 520 billion to deliver the green deal okay yearly additional on
56:10
top of what we're already doing according to others McKinsey for instance they say we need 930 billion of
56:17
additional yearly Investments on top of what we're already doing and the thing is 60 of that sixty percent of those
56:24
Investments that we need they don't have a business case right now so they won't generate profits so the markets won't
56:30
deliver that but we need them otherwise we won't get the transformation done it's pretty simple
56:35
so dear politicians and policy makers here's what you can do to mobilize the finance that we need for
56:42
that transformation you need to create more 201st Century business models to
56:49
mobilize Investments and for that active industrial policy is key and the U is doing that a bit now with the Green Day
56:55
industrial plan which is a good step in the right direction and you already said it as though we're going to need conditionalities here because it's
57:01
essential that any government support to Green Industries whether it comes from additional EU funds through subsidies or
57:08
in any other way it's essential that all of that is not just free hands-outs to any companies you need to make sure that
57:14
companies receiving that support that they are fully on board with that transformation only the businesses
57:20
really really well suited to the job should get State support and the easiest way to control that is to tie any
57:28
government support to the achievement of Social and ecological performance goals and if the goals are not met you just
57:34
take the support away again it's a very simple general rule businesses that aren't all in for the transformation get
57:41
out the way [Applause]
57:50
okay even if we do all that really well the second thing is you know like if we
57:55
drive in all those Investments that works really well that still leaves us with roughly 25 of those 500 to 900
58:01
billion yearly that's going to be financed by the governments it has to be
58:06
it's like schools and infrastructure and all these things and the discussion at this conference I
58:12
think showed us very clearly that member states many member states they just don't have sufficient room for those
58:17
Investments at the moment so right now we risk leaving them behind and you made
58:22
a good point about the fiscal rule so I'm not going to say anything more about the fiscal rules that's the one thing that we can do the second thing that we
58:29
can do and I think that's essential as well is we also going to need EU level support for this to have enough
58:35
Investments and one thing that we believe is quite you know maybe the most feasible thing to do at the moment is to
58:42
have an EU level sustainable Prosperity fund that borrows additional money from financial markets and you know investors
58:49
directly into green transformational projects
58:56
and then last thing on money I promise it sorry I'm an economist last point I think the money is already there it is
59:03
it's really there it's just sitting on the Cayman Islands and not doing its job if
59:12
you know like the money is extremely and increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few between and I'm gonna add some
59:18
numbers to yours between 2020 and 2022 in two years roughly 26 trillion Euro
59:25
went to the richest one percent on top of what they already have 26 trillion we
59:31
need in the EU overall around exactly that amount of Finance the full green transformation okay so let's not make it
59:38
as Kate said Finance versus life but you know let's use that money instead to
59:44
create sustainable prosperity for all
59:52
and then finally and I will make that short because here many concrete points on that pass rate number three none of this stuff is going to work if we don't
59:58
bring people with us on this transition and right now we see governments trying
1:00:04
to make up for the lost time in the slow progress on the green transformation of the past with measures that are
1:00:09
essentially imposed on people without implementing them and hey surprise surprise you know they face backlash you
1:00:16
see that in France with the yellow vest you see it with the farmers in the Netherlands there are many examples and there will be trade-offs that's
1:00:22
inevitable but let's not make it you know livelihoods of the people versus
1:00:27
Environmental Protection and I think one interesting thing that we can learn from those situations is
1:00:36
after my core failed to implement the Petra attacks because of the yellow vests he created a Citizens Council
1:00:43
and he asked the people in the Citizens Council to come up with you know Green transformative proposals
1:00:50
and what's interesting about it is the stuff they came up with was actually much more transformative than original
1:00:56
petrol tax and it went like they had social measures to go along with it of
1:01:01
course you still have to implement it my car didn't do that which is a big problem because then you really lose trust of the people so you should do it
1:01:07
like that it's not what I'm saying but I think it was really interesting so if you would Implement that you know you would have a really interesting set of
1:01:14
proposals by the people so by involving the people you actually don't slow down the transition but you make it possible
1:01:24
thank you [Applause]
1:01:31
and with those three points by having a new North Star mobilizing enough finance
1:01:36
and taking the people along I think we can already take a huge step forward towards creating sustainable prosperity
1:01:43
for all in the EU thank you very much [Applause]
1:01:52
[Applause]
1:01:58
thank you Jacob uh curious to see what I don't know
1:02:04
Christian lindsner might think of all this uh yeah anyway uh not now let me go to our two
1:02:12
final speakers it does struck me starting concrete
1:02:17
that all leaders of the youth climate movement have been women
1:02:23
I don't think I don't think this is by chance
1:02:32
I don't think it is by chance I said that at the opening of the of the uh
1:02:37
those three days that or current Paradigm is pretty masculine right and
1:02:42
if we want to find a way out maybe we need a shift there and so I gotta I'll
1:02:48
give you the floor the floor first and we will finish with anona I got over to you
1:02:53
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
1:03:02
foreign it is an honor to stand here in front of you today among such incredible speakers
1:03:07
and guests thank you very much for for the invitation and for giving a space to young people also to express our
1:03:14
priorities and our vision for the future the evidence is clear
1:03:20
young people and future Generations are on track to inherit a planet that is
1:03:25
uninhabitable if we don't act by 2030 billions of
1:03:32
people will lack access to clean and safe water for their needs and more regions will face acute water scarcity
1:03:41
by 2040 the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters
1:03:46
such as hurricanes and floods will leave billions displays causing immense
1:03:51
suffering and loss of homes by 2050 the depletion of critical
1:03:58
resources like land and fresh water will lead to food shortages on a global scale
1:04:04
leaving billions of people vulnerable to malnutrition and hunger
1:04:11
socioecological crisis stem from the prevailing capitalist economic system
1:04:17
where our Relentless pursuit of growth and profit clashes with the finite
1:04:23
limits of our planet and the well-being of people the past Decades of environmental
1:04:29
politics have failed to guide us toward human and planetary well-being
1:04:35
we need a new vision of prosperity one that is focused on meeting the fundamental needs and rights of all
1:04:41
providing a safe and just space in which everyone can Thrive within planetary
1:04:47
boundaries one that is based on intergenerational collaboration
1:04:52
so how can we create a post-growth economy that respects all generations
1:04:58
well first we need to listen to their concerns their priorities and their vision
1:05:04
so over the past months a generation climate year of we have worked together with youth organizations youth networks
1:05:10
and think tanks to co-create that vision for postgrove society and new voices
1:05:15
across Europe and Beyond have United calling for an economic system that
1:05:21
moves toward planetary and human well-being we have created a Manifesto for
1:05:27
intergenerationally just post-growth economy supported by youth organizations
1:05:32
representing over 20 million young people
1:05:42
and supported by several academics and experts this is not just another advocacy paper
1:05:49
this is the call of Youth claiming the rights to their future
1:05:57
through this Manifesto we are urging EU policy makers to transform the current
1:06:02
economic system and Implement specific actionable policies toward a post-growth
1:06:07
economy we're mobilizing the potential of young people as system thinkers who
1:06:12
understand the bigger picture of the crises we're facing the manifesto gives a comprehensive
1:06:18
overview of key elements for future of prosperity we're calling for absolute reduction of
1:06:25
our resource consumption slashing production of resource intensive goods and services such as the meat industry
1:06:31
automotive industry and fast fashion
1:06:40
we're calling for prioritizing decolonial Justice for a system [Applause]
1:06:51
for a system of universal basic services including affordable housing high
1:06:56
quality Healthcare accessible education and public transportation intergenerational Justice also requires
1:07:03
equal employment opportunities and career choices for young people too many green jobs remain Out Of Reach
1:07:10
for young people due to accessibility and affordability barriers we are calling the EU to ban unpaid internships
1:07:17
across all member states [Applause]
1:07:25
[Music] we're calling for dismantling and
1:07:31
already dying and deadly fossil fuel industry and for the EU to withdraw from the energy Charter treaty
1:07:37
[Applause]
1:07:42
but all of this cannot happen without meaningful engagement of young people and youth organizations and that means
1:07:49
engagement that is regular that is not happening on a one-time basis that is diverse that is engaging different young
1:07:55
people from many different backgrounds if it's not just one group with one common opinion
1:08:01
it's engagement that is structured that means Incorporated in the decision-making processes and with a
1:08:06
follow-up mechanism inviting young people to share their opinions is not difficult I can assure that you have a
1:08:13
lot of opinions it is the key to ensure that these RDS are actually being considered and responded to
1:08:20
[Applause] over the last years we have seen more
1:08:27
and more young people speaking in various International fora but youth engagement has since become a
1:08:33
bit of a buzzword too often used without a solid grasp of what it actually means
1:08:38
and this puts us at the higher risk of Youth washing whereby young people are involved in a superficial and tokenistic
1:08:46
way millions of young people are volunteering every single day dedicating
1:08:52
the time their energy their passion to make our world a better place for all
1:08:58
and they don't have the same resources or influence that many governments or corporations have but they continue to
1:09:05
go on because it is literally our lives that are at stake
1:09:10
[Applause]
1:09:17
I often hear from decision makers that with their commitment in action young people give them hope for the future
1:09:26
and that they make them more certain that the next Generations will fix the world
1:09:32
so let me get things clear young people are not responsible for
1:09:37
giving you hope and future Generations are not responsible for fixing today's failed leadership
1:09:44
[Applause]
1:09:53
[Music]
1:09:59
[Applause]
1:10:20
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
1:10:28
we will feel hope once we see ambitious action taken by our decision makers we'll heal folk hope when policies are
1:10:36
informed by evidence and science we will field hope when the daily news of the climate emergency are not fueling our
1:10:43
climate anxiety we must build an economy that grows the well-being of people and planets not
1:10:51
fills the pockets of the top one percent of the ultra rich extreme affluence drives over
1:10:57
consumption and devastating environmental and social impacts and
1:11:03
these adverse impacts are disproportionately borne by those who are marginalized and living in poverty
1:11:08
within Europe and globally a transition to post-growth economy is a
1:11:14
story of privilege as the global North we bear the responsibility to harness that privilege
1:11:20
as a catalyst for change a transition to a post-growth economy is
1:11:26
the opportunity to redefine prosperity and progress in a way that respects our
1:11:31
planet's limits and enhances human well-being
1:11:38
postgrove is not yet present in the EU policies Frameworks and measures at this
1:11:43
scale reach this conference is in fact an exception showing that there is a growing momentum and support for New
1:11:49
Economic thinking these free days have been packed with Incredible sessions it brought together over 4 000 people in
1:11:56
person in line to show the potential of a multi-party collaboration and it was made possible by a dedication of of MEP
1:12:03
Lambert and other MEPS incredibly in Francois European Parliament staff the
1:12:08
interpreters and numerous Civil Society partner organizations and countless others so thank you so much for your
1:12:14
incredible word making it happen [Applause] [Music]
1:12:24
however let us not be deceived into believing that the conference itself was
1:12:29
the most difficult part of this transition to a post-growth economy it is what we choose to do next that
1:12:36
matters and I Envision the future where we look back at this Beyond growth conference
1:12:42
and we don't see it as yet another talking shop but a key moment where Europe took a path toward a post-growth
1:12:49
economy where we can look back and remember that this is where the idea of the next European post-growth deal grewings and
1:12:56
spreads among different institutions so let's leave behind those empty words
1:13:01
and focus on meaningful action over the past three days I have heard
1:13:06
academic experts in Civil Society organizations urgently calling to listen to evidence
1:13:12
and to science and I heard decision makers responding with myths of decoupling and fair Tales of sustainable
1:13:19
growth [Applause] [Music]
1:13:26
in the opening plenary president mitzel emphasized the importance of growth we
1:13:31
have to deliver now as much as for the next Generations so let me be clear
1:13:39
future Generations don't need our obsession with economic growth
1:13:48
they need a life where they don't have to fight for access to food and water a
1:13:53
life where they can experience happiness and well-being without sacrificing their mental health a life where the
1:14:00
governments listen to people a life where they can trust decision makers to take ambitious action based on science
1:14:07
and evidence a life where well-being drives our decisions and policies a life
1:14:13
in harmony with nature where our planet is flourishing a life where everybody's
1:14:19
fundamental human rights are respected and everyone is able to live a dignified life in Comfort health safety and
1:14:26
happiness and I am standing here ready to fight for that future
1:14:31
are you with me [Applause]
1:14:43
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
1:14:52
[Applause]
1:14:57
[Applause] well thank you Agata uh I think you are
1:15:03
confirming that the level of energy in this room remains quite high after three days well probably you are contributing
1:15:09
to that like many other speakers but this is really remarkable some Parliament staff told me that they never saw that that they see people leaving as
1:15:17
soon as possible to take uh to take a drink on the Placid example but not here
1:15:22
not here apparently first time we met
1:15:28
uh actually on the plastic example the former railway station actually and I
1:15:34
remember because I had heard I think the day before your namesake uh speaking
1:15:40
about you as a doom thinker a doom banker and I felt this is remarkable I
1:15:47
mean so you have here well thousands of mobilized young people
1:15:53
who aspire to a bright future and they are qualified by the arguably leading
1:15:59
Flemish politician as doomsayers something must be wrong right with him I
1:16:06
mean obviously he's probably a man of the past or maybe he's the doobsayer go
1:16:14
ahead [Applause]
1:16:26
thank you and and I'm really happy that Agata and I got to speak here as a youth
1:16:31
activist because I know that we carry a not so diplomatic reputation so I hope
1:16:38
to live up to that promise
1:16:43
I thinking Philip for taking the lead on organizing this event because I know that what is perceived as
1:16:50
radical changes with the individual context that we are in and I find it
1:16:55
radically Brave and courageous of you and your colleagues to put this conversation forward here and set a new
1:17:01
bar for this institution [Applause]
1:17:10
I also want to acknowledge and thank all of the speakers staff and participants who made this event possible because
1:17:17
I've seen incredible people that have proposed radical ways forward and I know
1:17:22
that some of you have fought for these ideas for decades and I can only imagine how special it is for them to share it
1:17:29
in a space like this so thank you for taking the lead on mainstreaming a conversation on D growth beyond the
1:17:35
stage of this hemicycle
1:17:43
what have we done here for the past three days we are fundamentally rethinking the
1:17:50
global economy because we must infinite growth on finite resources is
1:17:56
not only a myth but it's extractivist and ruthlessly oppressive by Design
1:18:02
in essence it is a system of Institutions which determine who wins and who loses in The Game of Life
1:18:10
so when talking about growth and defending growth there is a very important first question that we need to
1:18:17
ask ourselves who are we growing this economy for and
1:18:22
what stories do we use to justify it [Applause]
1:18:32
I'm going to say something that is unfortunately controversial to this
1:18:37
institution but it really shouldn't be if we move Beyond growth we have to
1:18:43
acknowledge what lays below our growth white supremacy colonialism and
1:18:49
imperialism [Applause]
1:19:00
and I I really wanted to join Professor Sultana and the other speakers who made sure this is a dress
1:19:06
white supremacy justifies a global system of exploitation and extractivism
1:19:12
colonialism lays at the foundations of the European economy institutions
1:19:17
corporate value chains trade deals investment agreements and geopolitical structures of wealth accumulation which
1:19:24
means that there is no degrowth without decolonization [Applause]
1:19:33
foreign [Applause] [Music]
1:19:42
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
1:19:50
systems our economies are growing for some of us on the backs of many of us
1:19:55
not only must we see and speak the truth about this system we also have to change
1:20:01
it on every level talk about the dangerous systems of deadly growth everywhere with everyone and make sure
1:20:09
that they that every conversation about climate change includes a conversation about its root causes
1:20:16
and that brings me to a second question who are we including in the
1:20:21
conversations about growth some of the conversations we had here
1:20:27
may seem radical for people who are only able to think within a system of
1:20:32
infinite growth and that's why we need to have these debates in a radically different way and
1:20:39
move from panels to real dialogue to some of the politicians that were on the stages these past days I do invite you
1:20:47
to switch places sometime and listen to the real concerns and anger of people in this room
1:20:53
foreign
1:20:58
we need to take these conversations outside of these rooms and make sure that for all of the hundreds of fossil
1:21:05
fuel lobbyists demanding growth there are thousands of us demanding degrowth
1:21:11
[Applause]
1:21:18
because if we don't manage to put these conversations into action we end up debating another 50 years without
1:21:24
fundamental and systemic changes and we don't have that time
1:21:31
we don't have that time we all agree I often hear people tell me that change
1:21:38
is complex and therefore slow I disagree I don't think change is
1:21:44
complex I think enacting change is simply about changing the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the
1:21:51
world the idea of scarcity is artificial the
1:21:56
obsession with growth is artificial and the whole concept of develop development
1:22:01
and whatever that means is artificial
1:22:08
[Applause] and it's a really really really good
1:22:13
thing that many of us are not buying it anymore what we need is an economy that scales
1:22:19
down everything that is harmful and unnecessary as soon as possible
1:22:24
and there's tons of empirical evidence that has established de-growth is fundamental to the remaining time in
1:22:30
carbon budget we have to mitigate the climate crisis but as Julia Steinberger noted yesterday
1:22:36
there is a massive disparity between the stories of scientists and the stories of
1:22:42
policy makers we are not talking about scientific or economic feasibility we
1:22:48
are talking about courage European leaders if you lack political
1:22:54
bravery to make Paradigm shifting decisions then leave it to us
1:22:59
[Applause]
1:23:10
bring us into real decision-making spaces organize people's assembly and
1:23:16
make your decisions in collaboration with the people affected by your policies understand that the leadership
1:23:24
that got us into this crisis will not be the leadership that gets us out
1:23:30
I mean once a world of radical abundance a world in which many worlds are possible with an economy
1:23:37
that serves our needs a society that celebrates our differences inside a new
1:23:43
paradigm that feeds our souls we are fighting for Freedom not The
1:23:48
Superficial freedom to work in jobs we don't like to sell things no one really wants we fight for the Deep freedom to
1:23:56
build meaningful meaningful lives without depending on growth
1:24:02
I was asked was asked to end this intervention with a note on next steps and I think that the necessary policy
1:24:09
changes are very clear we need to redistribute wealth cancel climate debt Implement a universal basic
1:24:16
income massively invest in loss and damage funds degrow the economy in high income countries increase Universal
1:24:23
Public Services reduce working time dematerialize and re-prioritize what it
1:24:28
means to live a human life [Applause]
1:24:49
as Europeans that means we have to be humble acknowledge that we don't actually have
1:24:57
all the answers we need to learn from the global majority or decolonial
1:25:02
thought leadership has originally developed degrowth thinking and as a movement
1:25:09
as movements where do we go we need to make sure the conversation
1:25:15
doesn't end here if you come from a movement or you belong to a movement right now and you
1:25:22
commit to continuing this conversation Beyond this conference please if you can
1:25:27
stand up if you consider yourself an activist and
1:25:33
you commit to continuing this conversation Beyond this conference please stand up and if you are a politician a scientist
1:25:40
or anyone who commits to continuing this conversation Beyond this conference and when looking at my fellow panelists now
1:25:48
especially you Philip please stand up
1:25:54
[Applause]
1:26:08
I I know that many of you have a lot more to say beyond what was said in this
1:26:13
uh during the past three days and I want to share this stage with some of my fellow activists by reading some of
1:26:19
their key messages that were left out of the conversation so I want to invite those who have a message to please show
1:26:26
it to us [Applause]
1:26:51
thank you [Applause] [Music]
1:26:57
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
1:27:16
I I hope I hope that you can read some of
1:27:22
the messages that are on there but to make it easy I can voice some of the things that we can read on the boards
1:27:29
growth kills lives stop the fossil fuel Lobby
1:27:35
dismantle patriarchal systems
1:27:41
that was one of my favorites too canceled that land sovereignty now
1:27:48
and abolish Fortress Europe [Applause]
1:28:01
[Music]
1:28:07
this right here is the movement of movements that Naomi Klein talks about
1:28:13
and I want the end I want to end my speech with a quote from her
1:28:19
only Mass social movements can save us now and if that happens and we can build
1:28:26
a movement of movements well it changes absolutely everything
1:28:40
the movements that she's talking about already exist and they grow every day we have little time we have many voices and
1:28:48
people keep speaking until infinite economic growth is an old story from the
1:28:54
past thank you [Applause]
1:29:35
thank you anuda now I have understood I have understood back the river when he
1:29:42
said you're a doomsayer I understand for whom you are a
1:29:48
doomsayer for his friends for his friends
1:29:55
yeah the battle is not over now I'm in front of dilemma because well it's
1:30:00
already five past if we take questions sit for five minutes I need really 20
1:30:06
minutes to conclude because we need to give thanks and that's an important part of the thing so I would say since after
1:30:12
the closing of this disciplinary we have drinks there will be ample time to
1:30:18
socialize ask questions and so much was said in a so energetic fashion
1:30:26
I have the impression that if we go to to questions it might be an anti-climax so
1:30:32
so how about stopping it here I will give the closing remarks you may stay here you may go back in the room if you
1:30:38
prefer but let's get to the conclusion maybe ah yes my lady
1:30:44
you have the floor do we know yeah thank you so much for
1:30:51
giving up Lauren for a question we acknowledge the Emperors that have been puted into this conference but we are in
1:30:59
a state of emergency we are in a state of desperation and
1:31:05
just today's scientists have warned that the word likely to breach 1.5 degree
1:31:12
climate threshold by 2027.
1:31:17
2027. so the young growth will only be possible when committing to abolishing
1:31:25
the profit imperative and class society when acting upon historical
1:31:31
responsibilities to and racism and colonialism when leaving no one behind
1:31:38
goes beyond a beautiful Mantra in a discourse and Beyond Europe
1:31:44
so what are you commissioners parliamentarians council members
1:31:52
concretely committing to when we demand you to escalate our struggle
1:31:59
to cancel all completely illegitimate depth and to stop cycles of Oppression
1:32:06
and repression and to move from the Beyond growth towards the D growth what
1:32:12
are you committing to [Applause]
1:32:37
I cannot answer for everyone that you mentioned I'm not a commission member I'm not a council member I'm just one of
1:32:44
the 705 MEPS but as a person I think that my action over the last 14 years
1:32:50
testifies that yes this is the agenda that I together with my my green
1:32:56
colleagues have been pushing and again we are not the only ones I think the people who organize this are coming from
1:33:02
different political families and I would say that in some families it took a bit more courage to be part of this agenda
1:33:09
than in others and so yes my commitment UF even though and I will say that in my conclusion
1:33:16
indeed a year from now I will no longer be a member of the European Parliament yet I will be part of the movement of
1:33:22
movements and I will remain foreign
1:33:36
so we've come to uh the temporary conclusions of our works so I'm going to
1:33:42
do two things I'm gonna give thanks and I'm gonna give a few uh thoughts
1:33:49
about the political follow-up office caveats I'm an emotional person
1:33:56
so sometimes tears overwhelm me
1:34:02
[Applause] I wanna
1:34:08
I wanna start with thanks I want to start with things because giving thanks is what makes us human
1:34:15
well one of the many things that make us human and so gratitude should never be a
1:34:20
footnote so I start with that thanking the 19 colleagues from five political groups as
1:34:27
I said who embarked into this project with enthusiasm and Trust most of them
1:34:32
said yes at the first meeting uh and we prove by doing that that
1:34:37
people here in the European Parliament can work across political boundaries for a common cause
1:34:43
and what a cause because it aims at no less that making just life possible for
1:34:49
all human beings all human beings present tend to come on this planet
1:34:54
or cooperation on this shows the way to go building broad coalitions to
1:35:01
transform our economies so that they serve life and not the other way around
1:35:13
maybe she doesn't agree entirely with say the ideas that we shared over
1:35:20
the last the last three days but when I asked her she literally opened the doors of our institution to
1:35:26
all of us bearing no effort to make it possible none of this could have happened if we did not have the
1:35:33
possibility to use the incredible facilities that the European taxpayers
1:35:38
have given us if we uh could not put them at the service of our discussions
1:35:43
to a view filling the Hemi cycle no less and all these other rooms to have all the technical infrastructure for you to
1:35:50
join online and this is symbolically powerful because this is the house of
1:35:57
European democracy this is your house [Applause]
1:36:05
I am incredibly proud to have you sitting in this very room which frankly
1:36:11
I never ever saw vibrating as it vibrated for the last three days
1:36:18
[Applause] I want to give a hard tip uh well the
1:36:25
Insiders know him to uh the former Chief of Stafford Roberta mezzola who is now the highest civil servant of
1:36:33
this Parliament Alessandro actually Alessandro was on the staff of the president of Department five years ago
1:36:40
it was it was tayani not really the most Progressive politician here yet open
1:36:47
enough to say okay do it do it will support you and therefore I would like to ask the parliament staff interpreters
1:36:54
ushers security but also communication scattering all who by that discrete yet
1:37:01
efficient Services made our lives easy during these uh these three days they have been incredibly professional and
1:37:07
everything was run smoothly thanks to a well-organized partition I wish to say special thanks to Lucha who has
1:37:14
coordinated all this to Anna Lucas Angelica Barbara and so many others
1:37:20
[Applause]
1:37:32
thank you
1:37:38
[Applause] then I want to thank the president of
1:37:46
the commission and the Commissioners five years ago the president of the commissioner basically pushed back didn't want to have any anything to do
1:37:52
with this this one and it came from the very top set okay I'm willing to engage and
1:37:58
indeed many of you may think that the speeches she delivered two days ago was
1:38:04
maybe not exactly the line that you would expect from a post-gross commission but this is not a post-gross commission
1:38:10
but having the leader of the commission coming from the European people's party that they were in that speech frankly well this
1:38:19
has never been heard from that position in Europe [Applause]
1:38:28
we need to push further and obviously we heard a number of Commissioners speaking here who seem to be a bit disconnected
1:38:34
with a number of scientific realities but we are going to continue pushing in that direction
1:38:40
but then of course we I want to extend my thanks to the researchers from the
1:38:46
European parliamentary research service and the European commission joint Resource Center these are two bodies not very well known they are doing research
1:38:54
scientific research academic research for the institutions and indeed it's the
1:39:00
first time that they produced papers on what we have been discussing so it
1:39:06
was officially produced it was not you know uh stuff produced by external think
1:39:12
tanks the internal think tanks basically produce something and frankly you you should read it because it's uh it's good
1:39:19
material for beginners I would say and you know many people in the institutions
1:39:24
are actually beginners on this topic so so it's well done
1:39:31
then there's my political group The Greens European tree Alliance uh well
1:39:37
the group of course we did that in an ecumenical uh way but uh my group provided substantial financial needs and
1:39:44
also people to make it certain that it would become the success that it has become we believed in it from the outset
1:39:52
and I'd like to thank Anna Jean Christian Simon Rita agnese Alex Claudio
1:39:58
and so many more because none of this would have happened without your engagement
1:40:11
then believe it or not last time we we had a few partners and starting Esther
1:40:17
with the European trade unions again from the beginning right this time we had no less than 60 partner
1:40:24
organizations across really the field of Civil Society media trade unions I
1:40:30
mentioned it they have helped us a lot broadening the scope the world view and I think that
1:40:37
all of them have a key role to play to indeed build this movement of movements that
1:40:43
you mentioned danuna moving forward and then I'd like to thank of course all
1:40:48
the speakers the contributors who participated in no less than Believe It or Not 27 panels for the in-depth
1:40:56
analysis of the problems at hand they're concrete innovative solutions and policy proposals they're thought-provoking
1:41:03
inspirational speeches and by the way the number of standing ovations that we've got here says it all and frankly I
1:41:11
am humbled by the extraordinary insightful interventions we had here I
1:41:16
didn't know half of you and I learned so much as policy makers you know we need poses
1:41:24
like this one because we are we are not just in a bubble we are also in a sort of continuous process of doing a
1:41:31
committee week a group week going to strasbu and and then again we start uh we need to have process like this to
1:41:37
reflect on where we stand where do we want to go how should we go there and mostly to collectively discuss and
1:41:44
imagine what sustainable Prosperity actually looks like to imagine a postgross Europe and its
1:41:51
relation and uh and Agata uh well drew the focus on that it relations with the
1:41:57
rest of the world because indeed it cannot be that we keep exploiting the rest of the planet well we are the
1:42:04
European Union citizens we are six seven percent of the global population there's no reason why we should have more than
1:42:10
our fair share of the resources that that this planet offers to us
1:42:16
[Applause] I'd like I'd like to thank Claudia who
1:42:23
has been busy three days uh graphically recording all debates your drawings are
1:42:29
invaluable capturing the very essence of what is being said today to consign it
1:42:35
also to memory and to make it understandable in a graphical way well sometimes we say you know a picture
1:42:41
speaks a thousand words thank you
1:42:50
less visible but no less crucial are all those invisible brains and hands I mean
1:42:56
not the invisible hands of the markets huh but those of the staff working with
1:43:01
the 20 MEPS who have organized the conference for smeps you know it's relatively easy to have an ID let's do a
1:43:08
great conference oh yes and then someone has to make it happen and that is of
1:43:13
course you know prepare the marshes we say in French and uh among them I'd like to call on stage of course
1:43:21
I'm getting emotional
1:43:27
where is my nose [Applause]
1:43:33
[Music] [Applause]
1:43:41
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
1:43:55
yeah so [Applause]
1:44:02
so yeah I'll join you [Applause]
1:44:12
[Music] [Applause] so stay on stage Francois joined the
1:44:20
team at the beginning of my last term so in in 2019 he replaced when you had been the the anchor of the first edition of
1:44:28
the conference and I told Francois if you come well your main task during this term will be to organize the second
1:44:34
Beyond gross conference in the European Parliament that was 2019 and then of
1:44:39
course kovitz truck but the work has already had already started so don't believe that it was just waiting for
1:44:45
coffee to be gone but of course it was a bit frustrating because it was start stop you know are we going to get out of
1:44:51
confinement do we do it no at the end of uh of 2021 we feel okay let's let's try
1:44:57
maybe spring 2022 and then yeah that's too risky let's do September and then
1:45:02
yeah but then given the size that this was taking we felt we might not have enough time to prepare so spring 2023 it
1:45:10
will be but so ever since transfer has been working on that and then two years ago Leia joined Leia is a sort of a
1:45:18
superstar hired by the French litigation of the the green group in the European Parliament but actually they were well
1:45:25
not really realizing the treasure that she is and therefore I found well I
1:45:32
think that I have a good idea where our skills and immense Talent could be put uh put to good use and you joined the
1:45:40
team and well I've never regretted it of course but I must say the French relegation was helpfully in making this
1:45:45
happen and so it's basically more than two years of work by two individuals making this thing happen so it's not a
1:45:52
small thing and so doing that every six months that might be a bit of a challenge Mino has been on the team
1:45:58
already since a long time he has managed a lot of well what you see on slido and technicalities well all the the it and
1:46:05
such stuff happening behind was pretty much Minor's work so thank you for all
1:46:11
of this so thank you again [Applause]
1:46:18
and finally it's you it's you uh you cannot imagine the energy that uh well
1:46:24
you've given me but I think everyone this is really a matter of shared energy you know
1:46:30
2 536 people registered to come in the
1:46:36
building 4920 people registered to follow from
1:46:41
remotely and by the way there was no mandatory registration for those who followed remotely
1:46:48
it's remarkable that we are all here in
1:46:53
University and that's a good lesson maybe for next time representing Academia Civil Society organizations
1:46:59
trade unions businesses not many of them only one business Federation accepted to
1:47:04
work with us semi-united shouldn't be a surprise because smes are
1:47:10
often on the losing end of this extractive system actually because they exploited themselves by the mega
1:47:16
concerns of this planet EU National institutions use movements
1:47:22
or simply citizens who wanted to to wanted it to be here with us I lost this
1:47:29
intergeneration audience and without being patronizing I find it remarkable
1:47:34
that so many young people came here to me it's really a Beacon of Hope and provides us with Incredible
1:47:41
energy because we together are sending a message to political parties including
1:47:46
mine starting by saying it's the economy stupid
1:47:52
you are showing that we can and should discuss this Central topic that you are
1:47:57
not fooled by the rhetoric of too many policy makers about growth about that
1:48:02
you demand that they listen to what science has to tell us indeed we need act science-based policies that's what
1:48:08
we need and basically that's what they tell us right when they want to authorize GMOs they say well it should be science based actually that that's uh
1:48:16
that's the science that that serves them well paid science I mean
1:48:21
um so we need to change all this we need basically to live well within planetary
1:48:27
boundaries we need Social Justice right Justice this is what we need uh
1:48:33
[Applause] we want [Applause]
1:48:39
uh and those who will come after us now
1:48:44
thanks having been extended let me share with you a few thoughts as to what would be next first what did I sense in this
1:48:52
room I sent three things you might say Okay Cartesian way of going about surf first a sense of gravity
1:49:00
I keep in mind two pictures one was shown by yamina saheb comparing
1:49:06
the world my generation the generation of my kids and the generation story of
1:49:11
my grandkids athlete of we live in and the one by you on so so showing how
1:49:20
much we already knew we shoot six of the nine planetary boundaries this is sobering
1:49:26
it may even be distressing but you know changing the world
1:49:32
demands that we start by taking a hard look at reality however frightening it
1:49:37
is I also felt and anula reminded us of it
1:49:42
as well as Agatha a sense of impatience and I would even say anger
1:49:49
it was 1972 what I was then nine years old when
1:49:56
the limits to growth report was issued science was then already warning us of
1:50:02
the deadly contradiction between growth and life and the first alarm Bells actually when
1:50:10
you think of it had already been sounded by Rachel Carson 10 years before with a
1:50:15
silent spring 1962 the year before I was born over those 60 years
1:50:21
a choice has been made consciously and consistently
1:50:26
by the majority not all but the majority of those who will political power to
1:50:32
ignore science so as to serve those who wield economic power
1:50:38
I call this not ignorance I call that utter dereliction of Duty
1:50:46
[Applause]
1:50:55
felt here was a sense of hope a collective's choice because I think
1:51:01
hope is a choice a colleges choice to believe that the path can still be found
1:51:08
out of the situation we are in we collectively
1:51:13
do not just receive all from these nice young people you know we collectively
1:51:19
choose to believe that Humanity knows its diversity and I agree very much of the with those who say we have to learn
1:51:26
from others indeed taking care of mother Earths while other civilizations have maybe
1:51:33
done a better job than us Westerner said that why don't we try to reinvent let's learn right
1:51:43
We believe We believe that Humanity needs diversity as a collective
1:51:49
resources of imagination it starts there creativity and love to live in peace
1:51:54
with and within the nature we belong to this hope is I believe the treasure that
1:52:00
we cannot afford to bury the fire that we cannot let be extinguished if we want
1:52:07
Humanity to thrive but as my colleague Martin horsick said
1:52:12
yesterday morning winning the argument will be a struggle
1:52:17
those who benefit from our extractive and exploitative economy stand to lose a lot at least in their terms of uh uh in
1:52:26
their own standards of wealth so count on them to be helped by the priests of
1:52:32
growth to mobilize all the resources of fear uncertainty and doubt to deter our
1:52:39
fellow citizens from the Urgent change of Direction I think I said it yesterday or the day before the people who
1:52:44
mentioned most the yellow vestsumi are the business federations they want us to look that way saying
1:52:51
well you know be careful you politicians to change your system because these people will revolt against you of course
1:52:58
so they distract the attention from the fact that basic exploitation happens at their hands
1:53:03
[Applause]
1:53:10
I hear I hear voices from the European People's Party you also
1:53:15
love on the client Zone and there I must really compliment against sirpa and and the other uh two
1:53:23
EPB members who have been here because indeed it takes courage to affirm values and frankly it's not of
1:53:31
today I know her since I I was in the European Parliament she has stood firm for her ideas which are really
1:53:39
resonating with the ideas that we've asked over the three days within a political group but this this political
1:53:46
party is telling us is really going on the offensive thing
1:53:53
okay we are losing ground the farmers are our last stronghold let's protect the farmers so they say well if we need
1:54:00
to feed the world we should actually double down on our industrial uh farming
1:54:06
system did I hear this well actually science tells us that the 40 of the land arable
1:54:15
land that is degraded is because of that industrial farming system so if
1:54:21
I have to follow Manfred Weber well so the boss of the European people's party so if I understand you're well Manfred
1:54:27
the best way to feed the world is to keep killing life in the soil so that it
1:54:32
becomes unable to be fruit as we say in French
1:54:37
[Applause]
1:54:46
I also hear the ayatollas of fiscal discipline basically arguing that it
1:54:53
would be morally wrong to bequeath the future generations of pile of public
1:54:59
debt yeah sure you write Christian Linder question Linda is one of those ayatollahs he's a finance minister in
1:55:06
Germany yeah you're right Christian and well too bad if the price of the discipline is
1:55:11
orchids a planet unfit for human life you clearly
1:55:16
you [Applause] well these these hayatolas if well like
1:55:25
all Ayatollah ever well quite interesting sense of priorities
1:55:35
a lot for climate we should take a pause a pause
1:55:43
you know we cannot continue constraining or economy by environmental legislation
1:55:49
we need to give breathing space to our industry they mean the shareholders you
1:55:54
see
1:56:02
actually the number of square meters is houses in Paris I think is not really compatible with a Beyond gross Europe
1:56:08
but anyway but he's right he's right I mean it is
1:56:13
us not understanding correctly and oftentimes he is willing to explain you again uh no no you're right so if I
1:56:21
understand you well we should ask the planet oppose in its reaction toward massive or
1:56:28
overexploitation you're right we are going to ask that the planet and once again I must say you proved the immense
1:56:33
superiority of your complex thought [Applause]
1:56:43
and actually [Music] actually what I've done here is I think
1:56:49
maybe using the best or the most powerful weapons against those ideas to show how ridiculous I would say
1:56:56
dangerously ridiculous they are laughter is sometimes the best way to put pay to
1:57:02
stupid ideas [Applause]
1:57:13
and however good or good will is if she does a second term she needs majorities
1:57:21
she can have the best ideas she is not Emmanuel macro I'm glad that we don't have an elected Queen in Europe
1:57:28
we have the leader of a commission she can propose legislation and we have
1:57:34
of course to put pressure so that this is good legislation aiming us at the postgross Europe
1:57:39
but then again if there's no majority here and no majority in the council we don't right so we need a majority here
1:57:47
that will widen deepen and embolden European green deals so that it puts us on the way towards Beyond Rose Europe
1:57:56
but this is a year from now and I'm sure that you don't want basically to sit there waiting or maybe Lobby your local
1:58:02
candidates before doing something so we have work to do together not to lose the momentum of created by this conference I
1:58:10
don't want this to be just a blip on the radio screen or basically good memory for me in my last term you
1:58:16
know to say ah I did this uh that was nicer so um so let me share a few ideas to keep the
1:58:23
energy flowing first all the material will be on the website you might say well that is not so
1:58:29
important actually it is so powerful as teaching materials learning material let's disseminate it and the speeches
1:58:37
that go with it it's not just a presentation because you know some well sometimes maybe often I'm more
1:58:43
inspired by by the words and sometimes I need a slide to back it up but I want to
1:58:49
feel you know the way arguments are presented and there was so much of that so much of that so everything will be uh
1:58:56
will be put on the website of the conferences uh as well as soon as possible second
1:59:04
quite obvious that you want to organize yourself collectively so no we cannot
1:59:11
share the email addresses of everyone with everyone we have the uh the gdpr so
1:59:16
the the the regulation on on data protection that we need to abide by because we abide by the
1:59:23
laws when they are for the general interest so
1:59:29
[Applause]
1:59:34
so if you read that as a sort of plea or endorsement of
1:59:40
peaceful civil disobedience yes that's it
1:59:46
[Applause] now we will
1:59:51
find a link on the website to a slack channel to for you to register so that
1:59:57
people can get in touch with one another it's managed by the well-being economy Alliance I thank them for providing the
2:00:03
opportunity to ensure that the bridges and parts that were built over the last three days can last over time because
2:00:09
indeed this is a marathon [Applause]
2:00:15
no I must also tell you of stuff that is already happening that was not specially
2:00:21
visible thanks to the commands Network the green European Foundation uh Tim Jackson and so also a number of MEPS
2:00:28
have hosted a meeting of national members of parliament trade unions uh
2:00:34
trying with one one aim replicating this kind of event in National parliaments at
2:00:39
National level so that indeed we multiply the impact [Applause]
2:00:46
then something that was even less easy build but which is really I think groundbreaking is something that was
2:00:53
organized by the zoo Institute the policy Labs what we try to do there was behind closed doors invite uh at the
2:01:02
civil servant level policy makers from Parliament Council and commission to try and get deeper into the
2:01:08
implications of all this into lawmaking uh I promising you that it will deliver
2:01:14
immediately the thing is that we are we have started the contamination and actually Zoe has been busy with that for
2:01:21
quite a while and we try to expand on that and and these workshops have been very uh very efficient uh let me see
2:01:32
almost at the end of it so yeah yes yes indeed uh we have a partner that
2:01:40
the European economic and social committee it's a community no one speaks about it's located next door and uh it
2:01:48
uh it brings people from Civil Society uh and uh social Partners basically
2:01:53
trade unions business federations to discuss economic and social issues and they ran already an event on these
2:02:00
topics a few months ago and there have been a partner in organizing this one and I understand they want to be even
2:02:06
more a partner organizing the next one now
2:02:13
I'm almost there actually we are going to uh to finish ahead of time uh and that's good I think because well we've
2:02:19
had our office here of talks the last the last three days uh I must mention
2:02:24
the next International D gross conference that will take place at the end of August in Zagreb in Croatia
2:02:33
[Applause] I will be there actually uh and then let
2:02:39
me finish this is really the last paragraph of my speech you know I told you a year from now I will no longer be
2:02:45
a member of the European Parliament that was my choice uh I think 15 years of
2:02:50
which 10 leading my group in this Parliament is enough uh so
2:02:56
I kept the promise I made five years ago organizing after the first one the second Beyond close conference in the
2:03:02
European Parliament but I cannot make you the promise that I will organize the third one now I have no doubt talking with people
2:03:10
during these three days and actually hearing their reactions that people in my group will be very very motivated to
2:03:18
organize the next one so uh we are going to continue always
2:03:25
always in uh sorry to use the word a communical spirit across political boundaries
2:03:31
because I do believe that not only there are actors of change in all political
2:03:37
families but we need actors of change in all political families if we want this to happen as far as I'm concerned rest
2:03:45
assured that I will remain committed to our common cause that is that we humans
2:03:51
can live in dignity and freedom on this wonderful Planet thank you
2:04:03
[Applause] thank you
2:04:14
thank you [Applause]
2:04:28
thank you thank you
2:04:34

2:04:40

2:04:47
what can I say [Applause]
2:05:03
are you crazy
2:05:12
so so apparently apparently a 60 year old
2:05:20
white man from Europe can still somehow resonate with the spirit of the
2:05:26
times I I have a friend who actually was a civil servant he made a new career a
2:05:31
French company made him an offer the French company was totally energy
2:05:37
I promise you one thing I won't do this [Applause]
