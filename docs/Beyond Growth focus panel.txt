11:20
dear listeners I'm very honored to be invited to this
11:25
room and to be the first speaker in this first panel which I think will be very important at this very important
11:33
conference I will begin with a short story it's a
11:39
personal story it starts in 2008. and I'm at the post office picking up a
11:47
package for a friend who has broken his foot and it's a kind of a problem for me it's
11:52
a bit problematic because I'm also having a child with me my firstborn and
11:57
she's only a couple of weeks old she's quite fussy hungry tired
12:04
but I managed to bring my package up to the living room of my friend and I plopped down in his sofa and I decide to
12:11
breastfeed my baby there and my friend he's one of the most
12:16
down-to-earth people I know I studied with him at the University and he was like a cliff that I could rest on when
12:23
we had too many deadlines and when I'm sitting there nursing my
12:28
little daughter all of a sudden out of the blue he says I bought land
12:34
because that's the only thing that will be worth anything in the future and in that moment all of the future
12:41
crashed down on me it became concrete and frightening and I was looking down
12:47
at this little life that I was holding in my arms with slightly too big ears and no hair
12:53
but utterly utterly beautiful and I thought what could I ever give you for
12:59
the future I can hardly buy the apartment that I'm living in let alone land
13:06
and after this he told me about peak oil and it's not as if I hadn't heard about picol before but it hadn't become a part
13:14
of my body yet and in the subsequent years I spent lots
13:19
of time understanding resource depletion and climate change and biodiversity loss
13:25
and I didn't get much happier so when it comes to growth or maybe
13:34
Beyond growth change the slide
13:41
note slides I'm kind of an agnostic I'm not entirely
13:46
sure what it will look like I only know that it's large scale it has to be
13:53
transformative and go deep and it's very very urgent
13:59
the problem is that we cannot only know what we're going from we also have to know what we're going towards
14:07
and here narratives can be both a support and an obstacle
14:13
so it can be a support in the sense that we can see where we're going or we can get energy in the direction where we're
14:20
going or that we can find agency in action in where we're going but it can also be an obstacle in the
14:27
sense that we tell our stories that it's impossible or that there are things that
14:33
are can't be changed or that are dead given like a law of nature
14:39
so are we heading towards a dawn in this picture or are we heading towards the
14:45
dusk I'm not sure in this presentation I'm going to talk
14:50
about narratives on three different levels you could say so on different granularities
14:56
I will talk about narratives as Grand narratives or World Views or culture that we don't
15:02
really see I will talk about scenarios as a way of understanding what needs to be done
15:09
and then I will also talk about stories so if we start with grand narratives
15:17
they are like the water that we're swimming in in and that's really hard to see
15:23
they affect what we think are is possible and there are these kind of deep held
15:29
truths of our reality but it could be otherwise and these
15:35
Grand narratives are often challenged and here I want to for example mention
15:41
the book The Dawn of everything by Graber and wengro where they show us that Human Social organization has been
15:49
far more varied than we ever thought possible and that the Agricultural Revolution actually wasn't a revolution
15:56
it took over 3000 years and we went in and out of growing things to it
16:03
so it could be otherwise
16:09
Vanessa Mercado de Oliveira she says modernity is faster than thought our
16:15
ideas are what is natural and what is part of our modern society seeps into
16:21
our brain quickly and it's hard to let go of other things that we have taken for
16:27
granted what about the selfish Gene that tells us that everything is a
16:33
competition and the strongest survives but that's not really true is it
16:38
science have shown Us in the last couple of decades that actually collaboration and
16:45
reciprocal relationship is as important and prevalent in nature
16:50
together is also a way of surviving
16:56
some of these ideas about what the world is is so deeply buried in our language that
17:02
we don't really see them anymore they are called root metaphors
17:08
for example within our Western modern society up is good and down is bad
17:16
and that might make it hard to break loose from this idea of Eternal growth
17:22
because growing is good
17:30
another root metaphor can talk about nature so is nature a
17:37
machine or something that we should conquer or is nature a web of life where we're
17:44
part of that web and every action that we do have repercussions on ourselves as
17:49
well as well as all living things in the world
17:55
so these deep held truths about our culture and our worldview can be changed
18:01
but it's really really hard so I'll move on to the next level of
18:07
narratives and I'll talk about scenarios so the picture you see here is from the latest ipcc report and it shows
18:15
different Pathways depending on how many how much we continue to emit
18:21
there's kind of a lack of detail here even though this particular slide is quite detailed and I will not go into
18:27
the details of it but really
18:32
what is everyday life in this picture how could I know what my life would be
18:38
in Sweden and what about other places it doesn't really say anything about tuvalu
18:44
or sub-Saharan Africa or anything else
18:53
it's hard to grasp I mean there's something here there's a red graph and
18:58
we understand that that's probably worse than the other ones but what's really going on
19:07
these are policy orienting scenarios and we need them desperately I
19:12
mean they're science based and they give us facts that can give us something to to work on if we want to change the
19:19
society and change the world but I think that we forget when we look
19:25
at these that we might need to do different things in different times so there's a beginning a beginning of
19:31
change and then we have to do some things and there's an end of change where we have to do other things
19:38
and it's hidden in these graphs you don't really see it might you might think that it's the same kind of action
19:43
we need all through these years if we want to not get two degrees of global
19:49
warming but that's not true we have to act differently in different times
19:55
and whose voices are not heard in this picture
20:01
and whose voices are heard in this picture
20:06
and honestly I have to admit that I don't really know how to act based on on
20:12
these scenarios what should i as an individual do faced
20:17
with these scenarios they scare me but I don't have agency
20:28
now I'll come back to stories these are the nitty-gritty detailed
20:34
everyday things that we do and tell each other and I'm going to give you an example that's been quite recently
20:43
the pandemic showed us that we could do much more digitally than we could before
20:49
we could use zoom to give lectures if I talk about myself as an academic
20:56
um and we could work from home that would mean less travel and less emission so that's good
21:01
and if you Google digitalization you find picture as this it's clean it's
21:07
neat it's very high tech but this is not what life looks like in
21:13
general so on this picture you see a colleague of mine working from home during the
21:19
pandemic and he's very proud because his wife was wrong the national encyclopedia
21:26
did come into use um it's used here to prop up an ironing
21:32
board and on the ironing board he has his keyboard and his Mouse and his house cat
21:40
and this the computer screen is you know put up on some kind of rickety solution
21:46
with board games so this is this is real life this is
21:52
what actually happens it's never very clean or frictionless
21:58
and we find Solutions and workarounds and we kind of do our best to do with what we have
22:07
and this says something about who we are and what we do and what is my agency
22:13
I can solve things in stories
22:19
so so everyday life is problem complex pragmatic weird
22:25
and full of life so in my own research I've been working
22:32
quite a lot with de-familarizing ourselves from what is taken for granted so that
22:38
we can find the agency and move forward what are the things that are lying underneath the surface what are the
22:46
everyday words that we use that actually has other types of meanings and direct
22:51
our thinking in the wrong way and I'm also very interested in which
22:58
stories give us agency so that change can happen
23:05
and I want to emphasize that neither of these different levels are wrong if we talk about Grand narratives or scenarios
23:12
or everyday stories but we have to move between them so that
23:20
we all can understand where we're heading and I think that very often the everyday
23:25
stories are forgotten we kind of get stuck on the scenarios and the numbers and the facts and it doesn't give us
23:34
agency they're abstracted and agency less
23:39
and I think that we all have to maybe collaborate in this so that we have more
23:45
transdisciplinary work to open up these scenarios of the future
23:50
and the visions of the future so that we all can connect with them not only with
23:55
our brain and our conceptual thinking but also with our hearts
24:03
so I'm very keen to listen to the next three speakers and I will listen with
24:10
attention and I will listen with the attention of a living being maybe I'm one of the
24:18
creatures in the soil in this picture or I'm one of these children that are
24:24
actually starting to wonder what kind of future they will have I will listen as a living being and I
24:31
will wander when the rest of the presenters present what will my life be
24:37
in your vision of the future thank you [Applause]
24:42
[Music]
24:51
before we come to the first speaker and we speak about the three models of growth we will do a slido test so you
24:59
can use um that instrument in order to answer
25:05
the following question and we will do it now and in the end of the three speakers
25:11
debate so the question is what narrative is needed to guide progress towards the
25:16
European Union that aims to prosper a green growth B past growth c d growth
25:25
D other and e no need to change the narrative
25:30
so please participate to that in order that we have a pre and a post
25:36
evaluation of your answers um and we will start immediately with
25:42
the first speaker that speaker is Michael Jacobs the Michael the floor is
25:48
yours
25:56
well this is a challenge isn't it uh I'm my my uh position on here which is not
26:03
actually my position but I'm happy to take it on because I like a challenge I'm at three percent uh I see
26:09
um uh which is a good challenge um and it's actually uh good for us today
26:15
um I have to say when I listen to the inspiring speakers uh this morning and to the audience reaction I thought okay
26:22
I'm going in as the uh as the advocate of green growth here I'm clearly the opposition
26:28
um and I can see that uh that appears to be true from the initial uh slido
26:34
results uh are normally not uh in fact uh the Green Road Advocate uh in these
26:40
kinds of things but I'm very happy to be so because I do think we need a bit of challenge today
26:45
um we are speaking at the uh in the European Parliament and we had uh this
26:51
morning a keynote speech from the president of the European commission who is in many ways the most
26:57
important uh person politician in Europe and I'm trying to move the slides on by
27:02
the way um and uh this is a woman who uh famously the U.S president used to say
27:09
um uh I thought it was going to be me first yes um used to say um when I want to ring
27:15
Europe who should I ring and the European uh Union invented the position of European commission president in
27:22
order to provide an answer so we have here for our Europe and she's telling us
27:28
that we need to go beyond growth and and to achieve a new growth model and I
27:33
think we should recognize that that is a historic moment um it is clearly easy for us to say but
27:40
that's not enough and I think I I would certainly agree with that but it is a historic moment when the president of
27:46
the European commission is willing uh to say that and her speeches are written she didn't say those things off the cuff
27:54
she knew what she was saying and I think this is a very significant moment uh the question obviously is what would that
28:00
new growth model be to her and do we want a new growth model or do we want
28:05
some other model uh altogether and I want to try and address some aspects of those uh issues in my remarks
28:13
um so let's first establish some uh pretty uh I hope in controvertible truths we cannot have growth continued
28:22
growth of material throughput and fossil fuel energy in our economic system
28:28
that's a fact that is no longer in dispute 50 years ago that was a
28:33
surprising fact and indeed at that point it option the limits to growth report that was its core conclusion from those very
28:40
primitive economic computer models which they generated which was that we could not have uh indefinitely material growth
28:48
including energy uh growth based on social fuels and remarkably those
28:54
results produced from those very simple computer models have proved very very prescient they didn't say we had to stop
29:00
growth immediately that all these terrible impacts would occur immediately they said within the next hundred years and most of the modeling most of the
29:06
scenarios showed around 50 years time and that's exactly what we're seeing today that is a fact so growth of
29:14
material consumption and fossil fuel energy is out of the question we know why because we can see the environmental
29:20
impacts that we are already occurring at our current levels of material throughput and fossil fuel energy use so
29:26
that's clear so anybody who says whatever they argue for otherwise that
29:32
we can carry on using fossil fuels in the same way that we can carry on growing our use of material material
29:38
resources is wrong that should be ruled out the interesting question is is there
29:44
a way of sustaining at a healthy ecologically healthy level uh the flows
29:51
of material and energy through the economy while you still have GDP growth
29:57
now we know another pretty incontrovertible fact the GDP is a very bad measure of as Robert Kennedy said
30:03
most of the things we value it's not a bad measure of one of the things that most people value which is the amount of
30:09
national income flowing around the economy it's a pretty good measure that's not perfect we know that there are lots of activities that occur
30:15
outside the monetary transactional economy which are not counted we know that there are some difficulties in
30:21
measuring certain kinds of outputs and so on uh and so we know lots of problems
30:26
of GDP but it isn't a bad measure of uh of uh of exchange and most of our
30:33
economy most of our economy even when you include non-uh non-exchange work occurs within that and mostly we like
30:41
that to go up and the reason we like it to go up is because it generates very
30:47
good things and I think it's really important in a conference that we that is devoted to Beyond growth that we
30:53
acknowledge that growth if nothing else were going on
30:59
would be good why because it gives us all these things it doesn't
31:04
automatically give us all these things we know that it is now possible to grow
31:10
and for inequality to rise so it doesn't reduce poverty in itself
31:15
but it's certainly historically been a very good way of reducing poverty if you
31:20
look at all the economies that have in in world history from the
31:26
industrialization which first started in Europe through to China and developing
31:32
countries today if you look at all of those that have reduced poverty in any material way it is consequent upon
31:38
economic growth absolutely clear historical uh fact um we know that for developed countries
31:45
which are trying to provide better Welfare Services particularly pensions for elderly populations growth is very
31:53
very useful growth gives us the profits let's be honest the capitalist profits
31:58
that go into the Pension funds that anybody has a who has a pension has and we need them to grow in order to provide
32:04
pensions particularly when our economies are relying on fewer and fewer working age people
32:11
um and of course if we want better welfare benefits if we want uh um uh better Public Services we want improved
32:16
Health Services education and so on which we still have a lot to do we want to protect public goods and so on it's
32:22
very helpful to have growth so let's not in our determination to move Beyond
32:27
growth to forget what GDP growth in general gives us but the other thing that seems to me to
32:34
be incontrovertible is when Nursery lion says we need a new growth model let's just take the word growth out of that
32:40
and say do we need a new model an economic model absolutely because
32:46
what we have in now we can see we've already sandrina's talked about the poly
32:52
crisis we have an economic model a capitalist economic model based largely on neoliberal Market principles which
32:58
has been more or less adopted everywhere in the developed World differing forms of it in different countries
33:03
um which has given us a climate crisis an environmental crisis a crisis of poverty a crisis of wealth inequality a
33:11
crisis of the loss of the public realm and so on and is that model working no
33:16
nobody would say it's working for a conservative politician like Ursula fondeline to stand up in Parliament and
33:21
say that model doesn't work which is what I heard her say I can't see how we can she can say we need a new model
33:27
unless she's saying that that's quite a thing because her wing of politics broadly speaking has been in favor of
33:33
that model so that's quite a thing for a conservative politician to say the model of capitalism that we've been using for
33:40
the last what 20 30 years pretty much everywhere in Europe doesn't work that's
33:45
quite a thing and that seems to me to be a useful basis on which we should uh run this conference that a conservative
33:52
politician acknowledging that the capitalist model of the last 30 years is not working it's not giving us the
33:57
things we want what I want to do in my uh remaining time is to explain what a
34:04
green growth version of a new model will will need to acknowledge
34:11
there is a question and I'm going to explain why this is remains a question about whether it is possible to have
34:17
growing GDP which might give us some of these things as well as a sustainable material and energy uh system that seems
34:25
to me to be an empirical question to which we don't know the answer because we've never tried doing it there are people who think that it's uh it's a
34:32
logical impossibility which I don't think is true but I also and this is what I'm going to say now because we've
34:37
got time for some discussion I want to be clear about what you can't argue if
34:43
you're in favor of green growth and this seems to be very important because a lot of politicians have latched on to green
34:48
growth as the easy compromise between what they've always believed which is we need growth and their new partial
34:55
perhaps commitments to the environment and green growth looks as if it solved their problem and we need to be very
35:01
clear I think about what we need here so some different ideas about green growth
35:08
um these are my uh names for them but it and I have written a bit about this but this seems to me to be important most
35:15
politicians and most business people when they talk about green growth use what I would describe as a very weak
35:21
version of it in which you get growth of GDP over a period uh in which uh environmental impacts per
35:29
unit of output Decline and by per unit of output we I mean
35:35
um for every dollar euro of uh GDP there is a lower environmental impact uh than
35:43
uh in previous in a previous period and most businesses now which have any kind
35:48
of sustainability commitments um are essentially practicing of kind of weak uh green growth strong green growth
35:55
is the idea that it isn't just per unit of output but across the whole of GDP
36:00
environmental impacts will decline even as GDP arises and that's a a strong
36:06
version which is the only version that we can accommodate the problem with the weak version is as soon as there is any
36:12
growth you are liable to uh to see um uh the the unit impact being outweighed by
36:19
the absolute impact we've got to acknowledge though that a lot of the evidence that is brought up
36:25
for even for strong green growth and I'll produce some charts in a minute is only partial there's a lot of emphasis
36:31
on what we've done to greenhouse gas emissions so Europe and indeed pretty much all developed countries have now
36:37
managed to decouple we'll look at those charts in a second um uh GDP growth from greenhouse gas
36:42
emissions and what those analyzes tend to forget is that we're not just facing a carbon crisis we're facing a crisis
36:49
across many many different environmental indicators and I don't think we could talk about green growth if we're only
36:55
talking about greenhouse gas emissions we also have to talk about other environmental indicators and as I shall
37:01
show they are not performing in the same way at all but in fact what we have to
37:06
do is we have to go beyond both of these because we know as uh sondrine said that
37:12
we are exceeding the planetary boundaries in many of the critical uh life support systems that the planet the
37:19
biosphere provides and we have to ensure that we come below those tipping points
37:25
and thresholds so we have to reduce our impacts not just at all but to a
37:31
sustainable level so what is the story of green growth so
37:36
far well we know that we have um uh in European uh countries
37:42
um in the developed world as a whole I thought I'd pick the US for this chart because uh the US is the country that has in general been a Lagarde we know
37:49
that we have now decoupled um uh initially uh we decoupled in a
37:54
relative way that is initially you can see that from uh 1990 I think the the chart starts
38:00
um uh the U.S emissions Rose more slowly the growth but over the last uh two decades they have been uh actually in
38:07
Decline and I put two lines on there because one of the things that
38:12
immediately is said if you say uh there's been a decoupling of growth and and CO2 emissions people say oh no but
38:19
we've exported all of our emissions to China um uh you mustn't only count the emissions that are produced within a
38:26
country so I got here the consumption-based CO2 emissions which is the emissions that should be attributed
38:31
to the US on the basis of its consumption that includes the emissions that are embodied in the goods and
38:37
services that it imports from abroad and they are on the decline as well not as much as production-based emissions
38:43
territory emissions but they are also uh in Decline um however globally we are clearly not
38:51
uh at a uh with we don't have a strong green growth story at all we have a weak green growth story there has been a
38:57
decoupling of growth rates from CO2 emissions uh and GDP globally
39:04
um really quite a strike striking one and as you can see um it's been leveling off for the last
39:09
decade so it's becoming flatter and flatter but it is still growing CO2 emissions the world is still producing
39:15
more CO2 emissions this is clearly an unsustainable part but there has been a a weak green growth a relative
39:22
decoupling as uh it's called um when we go to material consumption so
39:28
if we go beyond CO2 emissions then we see uh a even weaker uh story which is
39:35
that while Global GDP has been rising quite a lot so has not at the same rate
39:41
there has been a relative decoupling but it's really not nearly that significant across the whole of our material
39:47
consumption so this is a uh um a material consumption indicator as a
39:53
whole um and you can see that the productivity which is the efficiency with which we
39:58
use those material resources has been just a bit a little bit Rising it's been kind of flat to an early rise so again a
40:06
little bit of progress but not nearly enough to describe this as an acceptable sustainable green growth path and of
40:13
course as we know we are now very close to or Beyond some of the thresholds
40:18
which planetary boundary analysis has suggested where you get tipping points into different states and we are
40:26
um uh therefore not just interested in the direction of the the lines on the
40:32
chart but we're interested in where they get to by when it isn't sufficient to Simply change the
40:38
direction of the lines we need to get to a particular point and we're all familiar with the charts the one that uh
40:45
we've just seen the ipcc chart the CO2 emissions in a sustainable 1.5 degree
40:51
pathway has to hit zero and that was the remarkable shift in the global uh
40:56
climate change debate in the last 10 years where it was accepted and now politicians have accepted we have to get
41:02
to zero um and that's that was never true that was never the case when we passed the climate change act in the UK in 2008 we
41:09
thought we could do an 80 reduction in CO2 emissions that was the goal we set for 2050 we now know we need to get to
41:15
zero an acknowledgment by governments by the European commission that we have to get to zero
41:21
is an acknowledgment that it isn't just the direction there's an end point that we have to get to and we have to stay there we have to stay at zero
41:29
this is very important and so this is the chart that we really need to have this is an idealized chart when thinking
41:35
about what green growth means and I am willing to entertain a politics and a
41:41
political economy of green growth I think that and I will defend that in in the discussion but we need we need to
41:46
make sure that politicians are being kept honest when they talk about green growth a relative decoupling of environmental
41:55
impacts particularly just CO2 is not good enough that does not get us to a sustainable
42:01
world even an absolute decoupling of environmental impact from GDP growth
42:08
does not get us to a sustainable world we need to get to a sufficient
42:13
absolutely decoupling where our use of resources and the flows of energy
42:18
through our economic system globally are at sustainable levels within planetary
42:25
boundaries and so this is the crucial point it isn't just the direction it's a
42:30
destination and we've got to stick there and we are not on that at all and I'm grateful to Kate rayworth for putting
42:36
this chart in such a simple way uh I do have some more slides beyond
42:43
that are they not there can anyone else move the slide on
42:53
right okay so um how do we do this how can you get GDP
42:58
growth with uh with environmental uh impacts reduced this much we know that
43:04
there are many many things that we can do that we are not doing this is a circular economy here are a whole load of things which will reduce
43:10
environmental impacts uh uh uh the environmental impacts of GDP we know how
43:17
to do that we also have this in a slightly more mathematical form Paul ellick one of the uh early
43:23
environmentalists um came up with a an identity it's sometimes called the ellic equation where I equals PC2 the
43:30
environmental impact is a is a product of population consumption
43:35
um and the environmental impact of that consumption which is GDP um and we know that if we are if this is
43:43
true this is a very broad identity then every time we have GDP growth we have to
43:49
have much much much more environmental productivity Improvement
43:55
um we must grow they give you an example if you have a a growth rate of 2.8
44:02
percent that is a doubling of GDP Global GDP over the next uh 25 years that's not
44:08
an unlikely thing then we've got to improve the environmental productivity of our use of environmental resources uh
44:16
by 50 just to stay at the same damaging level of impact we have now just to stay
44:22
at the same damaging level of impact we have now if we want the global environment to improve we have to improve uh the way in which we use
44:29
resources by more than 50 percent um we now have quite a lot of evidence there's a good economic debate about
44:35
whether this is uh likely to occur what do we know well we know that we haven't done anything like this
44:42
um so so far there is very little evidence that we are we uh have been able to get on the right path but on the
44:47
other hand we haven't tried we've never had politicians who thought that was their purpose and economic policy makers
44:52
have never been asked to do that but we know there's been only a limited amount of decoupling so far but the challenge
44:59
is even bigger than this this is a chart I like to show my students this is uh
45:05
two charts basically the same idea from two different ipcc reports the first of
45:12
them from the first ipcc report the intergovernmental panel on climate change in 1990 uh the second one on the
45:18
right from their report on the 1.5 degree scenarios in 2018. uh just look
45:25
at scenario D in the left hand chart that was the sustainable uh scenario at
45:31
which in 1990 it was thought we would stabilize greenhouse gas emissions notice two things about it firstly it
45:37
doesn't go to zero even climate scientists hadn't realized at that point
45:42
that we needed to get to zero and secondly more interestingly look at the gradient look at the slope of the
45:49
left-hand curve and compare it with the slope on the right hand curve and if you're wondering uh the bottom axis I've
45:57
made the same length so I'm not cheating uh here uh visually we now have to do
46:02
this at an extraordinary rate honestly if there is anything my generation can
46:09
be criticized for there are many many things but one of them is why didn't you start when this the science first told
46:16
us this if we had started to do this seriously in 1990 we could have been on
46:21
that slope and I can tell you that would have been easier economically technologically politically we are now
46:28
being asked to do the right hand slope which looks very very difficult um and we're not on it we're not on it
46:35
also because as Jason said to us earlier if we want to be serious about global Equity that is allowing the rest of the
46:43
world a non-developed world a share of environmental resources uh we actually need to be on a faster slope this is
46:49
Kevin Anderson's analysis which shows that the UK's current trajectory in the UK has a very rapid trajectory of
46:55
emissions is not the trajectory you would be on if you took the UK as a
47:00
proportion of global consumption and basically allowed every country at an equal level we are still taking too many
47:07
of the world's resources we should be trying to do this faster and of course if we were not just trying to do
47:13
greenhouse gas emissions but across our environmental footprint uh we would have to do this even more uh WWF have tried
47:20
to estimate for the UK possibly for some other countries what our Total Environmental footprint is and how much
47:26
we need to reduce a whole bunch of other environmental indicators and you have really very large uh numbers literally
47:32
by 2030 between 40 and 90 reductions in our use of various environmental
47:39
resources so this is the challenge we have uh we have to do this not just production
47:45
emissions but consumption we have to acknowledge that um I will do it anyway we can we go back
47:52
to the slide I don't know whether that's telling me I need to rebound up I'm nearly finished um uh we need to do this for production
47:57
we need to do this across all environmental uh indicators and not just greenhouse gas emissions
48:03
um we need to uh do it uh very very rapidly because we are approaching tipping points and catastrophic points
48:10
and we need to do it in a way that allows other nations to catch up with this so this is the only green growth
48:16
that is acceptable it seems to me morally and politically um and this pre is to me the starting
48:23
place that we need to uh to uh start but there is a paradox it is without any
48:30
doubt that if we had less growth if we had less GDP flows
48:36
we would have less environmental impact that's true but it isn't the case that
48:44
that reducing GDP will give us less environmental impact
48:51
it works one way but it doesn't work the other why because in order to have less
48:57
environmental impact without simply shrinking the economy to a level that would not be publicly
49:03
acceptable we have to do a huge amount of investment in those techniques which
49:09
reduce environmental impact in renewable energy in demand Management in The
49:15
Greening of industry in The Greening of agriculture in Transport Systems that
49:20
investment is growth producing that investment will generate growth now
49:27
it may be that the things we also have to degrow because we will have to degrow the fossil fuel economy
49:33
will that will definitely cut GDP that will be its impact but whether or not
49:39
once those two things are netted out that scenario of rapid rapid large-scale
49:46
investments in decarbonization and reducing our environmental footprint will reduce GDP growth measured in GDP
49:54
that is not clear if you model this you find that you still get uh growth so
50:00
this is the Paradox of green growth the Paradox is that there is no question that growth generates environmental
50:07
degradation but we also know that decarbonizing and dematerializing our
50:12
GDP will also stimulate growth and that leads me to a simple conclusion which is
50:18
that those of us in this room who voted for degrowth those of us who voted for post-growth and those of us who voted to
50:25
go green growth are all on the same side for the next 20 years at least we all
50:32
want that decarbonization we want a new model that is not the last years of 30 years of capitalism we want a model of
50:39
the economy in which we prioritize environmental sustainability the reduction of inequality well-being and
50:46
resilience and we have very powerful enemies who are on the other side and their enemies
50:52
of all of us thank you [Music]
51:01
thank you very much Michael for your first plea in favor of four green growth
51:07
a brilliant conclusion I could write this for the Ender and conclusions
51:13
um and um you were the first competitor in that ring um between the different growth theories
51:21
and growth models we have now actually the second competitor it's a woman she's
51:27
normally connected online it's Maya guple
51:33
um from from the loifana University of Lunenburg the Amaya I hope you're there
51:40
I guess you can hear us you're there you connected she's there so um I didn't hear your
51:47
voice perhaps you could say a word I'll try my voice again it will give away
51:52
right away why nobody of you would like to sit next to me today I apologize for being sick Maya you have
52:00
the floor for 15 minutes thank you for doing it even if the circumstances are not so easy for you thank you for that
52:06
and you have the floor thank you thank you very much Crisco
52:11
um well to be giving it away right at the beginning I'm not so sure if I'm a competitor I think Michael kind of snug
52:17
out of that competing role and I think it is a very smart one not to have to compete too much but to really look at
52:23
where do we want to go well I would like to do starting from the postgres point
52:29
of view is to say or pick up one or two things that Elena you were saying in the
52:35
introductory remarks which is why do we associate growth with good
52:40
and I think this is an important thing because gross is only a means to end we
52:45
don't necessarily want to grow ever bigger I think all of us are okay with staying
52:51
between one maybe 50 and 2 meters high if we were growing endlessly this would
52:56
not be a very good place to be as a human being the same was trees so everything that's natural everything
53:01
that is growing for the real proper way of the word where it's coming from has
53:07
an optimal size has something where it works well for what it would like to achieve and what is a good way for its
53:15
functioning and this is why system thinkers like to think about where are the roots what are
53:20
we really talking about and this is where I think linking back to values is saying in the opening is one important
53:27
one and I would like to present from The View that we are basically
53:32
talking about three values that are important to societies when you look at
53:37
the social sciences give democracies to work and those three values I want to tag on
53:43
is security is freedom and its participation
53:50
and in all three of those I think unless you let go of the GDP growth narrative
53:55
we're risking democracy because from my point of view the GDP growth narrative is so broken
54:03
in society from three different angles that are particularly linked to those values but unless we do that we are
54:10
really risking being able to govern into the future in democracies and that's the point of view I'd like to take so really
54:16
talking about this from how do we steer and govern into a future without letting go of that narrative I
54:24
don't see it and this is why it's an imperative to stick together between the ones that I have seen this and are very cognizant
54:31
about the fact how narratives are shaping our societies but that we don't necessarily need new ones unless the old
54:36
ones are not working anymore because we're sense making creatures where humans coordinate their activities
54:42
through narratives and through key performance indicators and three metrics
54:47
and three models and the most influential language has become economics in the way that we discuss
54:53
whether we're going towards progress or no and this is why we have to look at this language when it is broken when it
54:59
is not showing us whether we are achieving our goals anymore and so there's three different narratives or the three different ends
55:05
where the narrative is broken I think is basically very much understood by different parts of our society
55:12
and unfortunately those different parts of society often played out against each other one is the ecological it is really
55:20
broken for everyone who has looked at it and Michael just made the case again the ecological point of view very
55:25
clearly lets you see that continued growth on a fossil base with that extraction level into what the planet
55:31
can provide for us is not going to work the second story that comes from a
55:36
different angle is making sure that the echelons in our society are alleviated
55:42
enough from burdens will lead to their investments will lead to the employment will lead to the incomes that will make
55:48
all boats wise so the checkout down effect is very much broken unfortunately
55:53
we see that those two have played out against each other so we can't afford ecological measures because then the
55:58
poorest will suffer from purchasing prices going up so we have to look into what's driving this and this the third
56:05
story that is broken for everyone who looks at what's driving that and that is the story that what's good for finance
56:10
is good for the real economy and I think there's a strong need to push back from those that are producing
56:17
that are bringing it into life the services that we need including the ones that you took about Michael and make
56:23
sure that we're also talking about ex Innovation so letting go of the ones that don't sell these purposes anymore and make sure that we show how much are
56:30
financialized way of leading an economy right now is hampering that Prospect
56:36
but I'd like to go into um the three a little bit more starting with the growth story broken on the
56:44
decoupling agenda and I think it speaks to the security value when really think about it and this is why young people
56:50
are in the streets and this is why in Germany in particular they feel so needed to do radical interventions into
56:57
those status quo the continuing of the status quo what we call normality because they see the consequences the
57:04
insecurity that they're being put towards unless we are changing fast
57:09
and so how do we speak now I'm really trying to put on the scientist hat with
57:15
everybody um without antagonizing but was really trying to
57:20
invite to look at the numbers in the the crunching and the model that we're trying to tell us where we're going in
57:26
particular when we speak with economists that are we're slowly creeping forward to understanding that there might be an
57:33
issue with decoupling they say or tend to say well just because it hasn't happened in the past it's not a proof
57:38
that can't happen in the future but then the necessary agenda very clearly is and this is why the green
57:44
deal is important and why the different measures are important is to measure why
57:49
it hasn't happened in the past that is a sound a solid a rational answer to a
57:56
diagnosis on the past I can only speak of evidence-based policy making and evidence-based advice if I'm willing to
58:04
say a it hasn't had in the past okay evidence approved and then B I'm looking
58:10
at the trends and the drivers of why that hasn't happened in order to formulate interventions that are far
58:15
beyond the CO2 price it's never going to be enough at all in order for us to stand a chance that it could it will
58:22
happen and so without that empirical soundness that rationale behind it this
58:27
is not evidence-based policy making it's not evidence-based advice and I think we have to be strong on this and then we
58:33
can argue about the best measures but unless we're looking at which measures have failed before it's not going to
58:39
happen and to really strongly push back as well on this oh all of a sudden you want to have or prohibit everything the
58:45
EU right now in Germany is a huge culprit for prohibiting the first one fuel engines really prohibiting the
58:52
heating systems or baits on gas well seriously we've been talking about this for 40 50 years now we've been going
58:59
through loads of different cycles of intervention from learning from public information from self
59:06
um commitment from incentives Etc so if policy making is not going towards
59:12
taking the responsibility when all the other measures that we've tried before have not been enough to say then we have
59:18
to regulate what is policy making for and this is the strong push that we need
59:24
from society and that we need from businesses that are seeing how things can look differently because otherwise without the stock
59:31
accounting without looking at what do we actually have how much do we have to provide for the future this is not a
59:38
sound analysis and this is not a sound answer especially not to the Young Generation
59:43
and this is why freedom I think is the second very very important point that we bring forward because this ensuring
59:50
liquidity at the top will grant the Investments That trickle down is just also not working and we've seen it
59:56
everywhere and the mentioning of Fleet Lambert of ownership I think is very very crucial there including the
1:00:02
tracking like Economist Isabella Vibe and others have been doing now where are
1:00:07
the benefits from reducing taxes on carpets from not raising taxes on wealth
1:00:13
Etc where are those going and obviously there's a lot of evidence to be found there
1:00:19
especially when we're thinking about infrastructures and how those have been privatized we see how when people depend
1:00:26
on particular services like housing it's a very nice income guarantee model for
1:00:32
the ones that are owning these infrastructures and if the concentration on ownership is completely in the hands
1:00:38
of five six maximum seven big corporations a lot of absentee ownership comes to it so the people are owning
1:00:45
meaning they want to make Financial returns from it sits in a different country from where the people that need
1:00:51
to pay to get access to it then it becomes really difficult and we've I've just been in one of the
1:00:57
lobby circles in Germany invited to speak where you hear that language where
1:01:02
you hear the tyranese of the old way of not looking at what it does to people and the real life indicators but only to
1:01:09
the financial indicators but it was talked about how the first thing that obviously obviously
1:01:16
um private Capital allocators were looking at was the rent increased potential that's their primary decision
1:01:23
making whether they go into a country or not and then Germany is now ranked as a
1:01:28
political risk country because we're not willing to let the values flow freely where they should be
1:01:34
going that means something like the rent should be let out to flow freely like they are in London in Paris in New York
1:01:42
and other places where people can't find access anymore and also these weird ideas that we might
1:01:48
want to restrict direct access with private vehicles to houses because we're
1:01:53
looking at livable spaces in cities political risk for investors
1:01:58
I think we have to be very clear that we talk about this that we're saying infrastructure we're very glad there are
1:02:03
panels on universal basic services are something where ownership is playing a crucial role absolutely crucial age
1:02:10
who's got access to it be to how much do we need of it why do people need to have four houses
1:02:17
in different places and then we say we have to build build more where is that supposed to go we don't really have the
1:02:23
space we need to talk about allocational resources and this is why the freedom to have
1:02:28
access to the basic services and the freedom to Coast steer where we're going in this is fundamental if democracy is
1:02:35
to be um held up and this is why we have to differentiate on that end as well
1:02:43
and I I think it is important to see how much that has been debated right now is a very encouraging moment we've seen it
1:02:50
in the fossil fuel sector even though we all find it outrageous what's happening there was the over
1:02:56
um or the profits made from a crisis or from a war in that matter leading to
1:03:01
um payments of 62 to the shareholders of the markups that we put on the price and
1:03:07
no girls in saying oh we're going to scrap the decarbonization pathways that we've committed to before because it's
1:03:12
just so lucrative right now to stay in the philosophy sector another absolute need for policy makers to intervene and
1:03:19
that is not destroying markets but that is helping us get out of structures that are not markets anymore but close to
1:03:26
feudalism and some of those very very important sectors in order for marketers will be able to work again so we have to
1:03:32
repair markets if they were to serve more um the customers and the clients Etc
1:03:38
that we all are when we're leading our consumer lives and the third one the last one the past
1:03:45
education takes that even one further and I think it is the most difficult one and I think it is where we're all
1:03:51
struggling with because we're talking about Democratic rulemaking that is helping for markets to help us get
1:03:57
access to goods and services but also to renegotiate what should be conducted by markets and under which circumstances or
1:04:04
which standards and that is the last story what is good for finance is good for the real economy and that
1:04:10
participation goes lost even more and I never forget when Larry Fink um the CEO
1:04:16
of BlackRock was starting to issue his letters about let me see your climate risks that was the moment where in
1:04:22
whichever evening keynote speech consultation with businesses in Germany
1:04:28
or Europe all of a sudden everybody was alerted oh now we really have to look at this now this is serious I was trying to
1:04:34
figure out why is that why is none of what we've been saying before from the political side that this is necessary
1:04:39
why didn't anything on that had the same effect and it is obviously that the belief that
1:04:45
prices won't be increased to the degree that it would actually have a prohibitive
1:04:50
impact on some of the business models that belief wasn't there
1:04:55
because there was a belief that it could be always presented by playing out the social against environmental and we see
1:05:02
that happen big time in Germany just now on the heating law and how the law says
1:05:07
you can't build in new fitting that is only gas
1:05:13
from next year onwards it's not about ripping out everybody's heaters but that's the way that it's being portrayed
1:05:18
because For the First Time a government in Germany is trying to really crack down on the ex Innovation Michael that
1:05:24
you're referring to to say some business models have to go if others need to grow in order for their servicing to become
1:05:30
more sustainable and so why is the most important for us or the most influential Force private
1:05:37
gigantic investors on the one hand we welcome that and on the other hand obviously it's terrible because they do
1:05:43
have another role which is we only accept the risks when they're
1:05:49
actually there and from Tipping Point Logics that will be too late because we have to act early and not only when
1:05:54
everybody is seeing that risks are here and obviously they far more often play the role of saying no you can't invest
1:06:01
too much in the redesign of your value chains because that will mean the short-term slump in return on invest so
1:06:08
the short-termism in this debt of Doom how do we get through that it can only work if we all collaborate between
1:06:14
policy making between the financial sector and between the productive side and the consumers that are holding this
1:06:19
and the media that are helping telling the story and have telling this narrative and how putting out the
1:06:25
indicators with which we're seeing where we are today what is actually what is costing us this and why protecting
1:06:32
security protecting freedom and predicting participation is what we're after when we're talking about getting
1:06:39
out of a growth model that is just obfuscating all of those things far too much when we're only looking at the
1:06:45
Blindfolded numbers of flowing cash in our economies this is why the post-growth narrative
1:06:51
For Me Maybe is the one that doesn't even put growth in its name anymore to just say it's been to our news and we
1:06:59
want to know that we are on the past on a well-being Society within planetary boundaries and then the huge question
1:07:05
for everyone Economist is to get to what sanjin was saying economic stability how do we manage that the absolute
1:07:12
massive amounts of cash that's the other good good news there's not too much or too little money around there is a lot
1:07:18
of money around it just goes through the wrong places and this is why the economic stability question from my point of view is the
1:07:24
one that needs to be Center Stage whilst looking at the stocks what is the security of ecological base that we have
1:07:30
in the future much more vividly and much more pronouncedly and obviously he's talking about who it has the freedom to
1:07:37
participate who has the freedom of access to what we know is the basis of well-being and thus freedom of speech
1:07:43
freedom of intervention of participation which is we can only do that if we feel secure enough not to be risking that
1:07:50
we're falling out of that security level and this is why I'm not so sure if I've lived up to the notion of having to
1:07:57
compete on the post-growth meaning growth model but I've tried to tell
1:08:02
everybody why it's important to a but growth as a means to an end and thus let go of putting it as a poster of the new
1:08:08
narrative and why an economy has to be at this service of a society and why every democracy that wants to be built
1:08:15
on evidence-based policy making and regain the three areas in our societies that are
1:08:21
really frustrated to losing trust to becoming cynic to becoming populist in
1:08:27
our societies is driven into unless we do so and this is why I think this conference is so crucial and thank you
1:08:34
very much for having me [Applause] [Music]
1:08:46
thank you very much the Amaya fin dank foreign
1:08:51
thank you for your argumentation about that post-growth narrative
1:08:57
um this was the second one we come to the third and last one this is the narrative and the arguments on and about
1:09:05
the the growth and um I give the floor to ikatarina
1:09:18
hello everyone a very nice to be here and to
1:09:25
discuss the pathways for socio-ecological transformation so thanks a lot to the organizers of the
1:09:31
conference and this panel in particular so I would like to start by saying that
1:09:37
I really do not agree that we need a new growth model so this is what has brought
1:09:43
the Deep crisis multiple crisis that we are into so instead what we need is to
1:09:49
go away from growth at the center of our economies and societies and towards
1:09:56
ecological psychological transformation based on well-being Justice and
1:10:03
strive for ecological sustainability so and this is where the growth comes in
1:10:09
and I must say I'm a bit disappointed that I haven't heard enough of it so far at this event and I hope more will come
1:10:17
so and I'm also happy that this is what brings many of us here at least from the
1:10:22
survey that I saw on the screen earlier so so that's that's great I think
1:10:28
so my role here today is to introduce the degrees the multiple vision of the
1:10:35
growth to people here today so there are different definitions but also some kind
1:10:42
of fundamental uh agreements that we share so and I can say that the growth
1:10:48
can be defined as this um an umbrella term that critics the centrality of
1:10:54
economic growth in today's economies and societies and six for reorganizing
1:11:00
Societies in ways which are ecologically sustainable and socially just and here I
1:11:06
would like to say that this entanglement of ecological
1:11:12
sustainability and social justice is something that is very key for the growth so one kind of doesn't go without
1:11:18
the other if we push for addressing the ecological crisis without thinking about
1:11:25
Justice that's just not uh going to work and that's not where we want to be going
1:11:30
so what also the growth means is an absolute reduction of biophysical
1:11:37
throughput so the use of energy and resources whilst ensuring well-being for
1:11:43
all and by all it's really like all in capital letters so we mean for everyone
1:11:48
on the planet so not just Europe but globally so
1:12:00
so the growth has been a burdening research area and one can say also a
1:12:05
social movement with a lot of discussion around it going on and one of a kind of
1:12:10
key um well there are two key pillars let's say of the gross discussion one is
1:12:15
critiquing economic growth and another which is really has been expanding and getting a lot of attention uh over the
1:12:22
years is exploring Alternatives and what alternatives could look like so I will try to unpack briefly both of those so
1:12:32
the gross argument is that the Perpetual
1:12:37
pursuit of economic growth is unsustainable so basically what we see
1:12:43
the evidence of and it has been already brought up at this conference is that
1:12:49
the pursuit of economic growth comes together with the use of energy and
1:12:55
resources and with the environmental pressures and the evidence of decoupling
1:13:02
at the global level which is something that we need to address the ecological crisis so climate climate
1:13:10
emergency and biodiversity laws and other problems that we are facing so
1:13:16
this is something this is the kind of global uh decoupling which we would need
1:13:21
but there is simply no evidence for for this thanks also Michael for elaborating on that earlier so the green growth
1:13:29
story is that a kind of a case that has been no the coupling but we can somehow
1:13:34
make it happen so it's based on several ideas so kind of beliefs so for example
1:13:41
there is this belief in service economy and kind of digital economy that this is
1:13:48
something that will bring growth without the material footprint but actually these economies have a huge material
1:13:56
footprint so you need for example for digital economy the data centers which
1:14:03
are very kind of uh energy hungry you need massive infrastructure like
1:14:08
undersea cables to make the internet connection
1:14:14
possible you need all sort of infrastructure that requires energy
1:14:20
materials and minerals so there is uh basically it is misleading to say that
1:14:26
digital economy is what will bring dematerialization uh to to us so then
1:14:33
there is also let's say the discussion and some hope in the expansion of
1:14:38
renewable energy and this is important and this is where uh we would agree I think in degrees
1:14:44
uh kind of movement that this is this is what is to expand uh in the growth
1:14:51
societies so however uh renewable energy requires also minerals and requires land
1:14:58
and this is the land where people live and do other things currently so then
1:15:04
even a lot of the kind of expansion of green stuff has been coming with a lot
1:15:09
of dispossession and um uh loss for many people so then when
1:15:16
it comes to the scenarios for addressing say the Paris agreement and meeting the
1:15:22
1.5 degree goal so the more optimistic scenarios really are very
1:15:28
problematically reliant on the technologies that do not exist and also are ethically
1:15:36
problematic like bioenergy with carbon capture and and storage so and also
1:15:43
these kinds of Technologies apart from not operating at a scale they will also come with bringing kind of more
1:15:49
hierarchies into today's societies and will make Democratic decision making about this Technologies very very hard
1:15:57
so and something that the Grocers have been bringing up a lot also is the uh
1:16:02
rebound effect so even if there are some kind of efficiency gains in the economy they will basically when an economy is
1:16:10
oriented at growth they will be rising growth of production and consumption in the end negating uh this efficiency
1:16:17
gains so this is not also enough so
1:16:22
hence this is this let's say environmental critique of growth that
1:16:28
has been very important for the degrees discussion and I think which is where we put a very solid scientific argument
1:16:35
that decoupling is not something to um to look for because because it is
1:16:42
unfeasible and that we should simply look for an alternative organizing of our economies
1:16:47
so however the growth is not just about decoupling so this pursuit of uh growth
1:16:55
it also comes with a lot of injustices so you can look here at the environmental justice Atlas that Maps
1:17:02
the different conflicts around the world uh in the pursuit of growth in capital
1:17:08
accumulation so and these are not all the conflicts these are just the ones that are on the map and we can also see
1:17:14
here the um unequal exchange between the global North and the global South so something
1:17:20
that has already been mentioned today with a lot of kind of so-called Imperial
1:17:26
mode of living and this consumerist way of living in the north depending on extraction and violence and
1:17:33
dispossession in the south so apart from this also if we look at
1:17:39
Europe there are also many environmental justice conflicts within Europe itself and overall we can see that there is
1:17:46
this well there is assumption that the growth somehow uh will bring the uh benefit to all and it's a good effects
1:17:53
will trickle down but it's not really what has been happening so since around the 80s the uh grows it has been
1:18:01
trickling down to the to the richest groups in the society so and with the
1:18:07
um the 99 so people have been suffering dispossessions or austerity and the very
1:18:14
negative effects of growth or recessions in gross-focused economies so and we
1:18:20
also see a global trend of inequalities Rising uh in in societies so there are many of these aspects where basically a
1:18:27
green growth story would think that Rose would deliver but it is not something that we see
1:18:34
so now the growth what does at the growth alternative look like so this can
1:18:40
be said as to be a vision for social ecological transformation and here I also stress the air Vision because it is
1:18:48
not some kind of Ideal that is to be imposed on everyone else it is one of
1:18:54
the Alternatives out there so and here the growth movement and the growth Scholars we are in dialogues and
1:19:01
alliances with the blue rivers of Alternatives around the world many of which also come from the global South
1:19:07
and show how a living away from growth not dependent on growth is possible and
1:19:15
desirable and and very yeah full of well-being too so
1:19:24
the image here demonstrates uh kind of the what we talk about when we discuss
1:19:30
the growth so it is not this kind of huge elephant that the economy is today they no offense to the elephants so but
1:19:37
it is a snail that moves kind of slower and at a good pace and focuses on
1:19:46
um well-being and sustainability instead so and also it is important to say that
1:19:51
the growth is not about kind of deliberately cutting GDP so it is not
1:19:56
about recession and reception is a consequence of gross-focused economies
1:20:02
and also the growth has nothing to do with austerity which is another consequence of gross-focused economies
1:20:07
which comes when a crisis hits and actually my kind of academic life and so
1:20:14
maybe activists like to some extent it's really associated with this constant waves of austerity so since 2008 a
1:20:21
financial crisis this is the only kind of faces of growth focused economies
1:20:26
that that I have seen and I don't really see another possibility for for that story
1:20:34
so then it is important to say what the growth offers let's say apart from a
1:20:41
critique so the growth is about living well within limits So within the
1:20:46
planetary boundaries but also societal boundaries so it is important to live
1:20:51
not at anyone else's expect expense so and in the growth so we
1:21:01
stress other values than what are key in the economies and societies today so
1:21:07
care uh conviviality Democratic direct Democratic decision making mutual Aid so
1:21:14
these are some of the key words in the degros vocabulary so the idea for the
1:21:19
societies is to provide level uh well-being for uh for all and
1:21:26
to ensure provisioning systems that enable that well-being so and this is
1:21:31
what economy should be about so it should not be an end in itself but a means to ensure good uh levels of uh of
1:21:40
well-being so uh then when it comes to the economic
1:21:46
kind of models and organizations so today really corporations and for-profit Enterprises are so key in economies so
1:21:54
they really drive the whole kind of green growth agenda the lobbying of Corporations is so much present in
1:22:01
institutions like the um European European commission so when
1:22:07
for example Frameworks like the European green deal
1:22:12
being implemented so so this is a problem and this is not where we see the
1:22:18
power SD gross Scholars and degrees movements so the power isn't bottom up bottom-up transformation and here there
1:22:26
are many organizations and kinds of organizing they can drive this transformation so we speak for example
1:22:32
of not-for-profit organizations as key to a degree's economy so for example
1:22:38
based on comparative principles or Community organizing or community
1:22:43
and but at the same time it is important to drive change at all levels so it is
1:22:49
important for institutional change and policy change also come in and help these alternatives to flourish or
1:22:56
support these alternatives so one may say when you present at the
1:23:01
gross Vision that okay it doesn't it sound a bit utopian does it really exist
1:23:06
and the thing is that there are really many Alternatives out there already so
1:23:12
there are for example renewable energy cooperatives with about 2 000 around
1:23:19
Europe that are already driving the transition to renewable energy there are
1:23:24
the um uh Global Echo Village Network
1:23:29
organizations or the uh Via Campesina movements that show how agroecology and
1:23:36
how food provisioning can be done without depending on uh problematic
1:23:41
agri-food systems so there are also examples of digital company for example about enabling plastic recycling locally
1:23:50
and sharing the kind of knowledge on the infrastructure to to be able to to do
1:23:56
this so so you name it and wherever you are you would be able to find different Alternatives of different kinds that you
1:24:04
can be a part of so so there are really many Alternatives they might seem small when you look the kind of at them but
1:24:11
actually when the United Network so when you see them mapped like this there are
1:24:17
there are many so but the problem is that they are barely noticeable in policy making today which kind of
1:24:23
largely avoids them and perhaps pursues the lines which are driven by for-profit
1:24:30
Enterprises so hence this is where also these
1:24:36
Alternatives really are suffering a lot in times of crisis when the energy prices are rising when there is overall
1:24:43
rise on the coast of leaving so it's really fragile to be doing something
1:24:49
alternative within the economy and this is where we need transformative policy making and this is what I hope that this
1:24:55
conference is going to help and drive us towards so when we speak of the gross policy
1:25:03
making perhaps I could identify at least three dimensions of that so on the one
1:25:10
hand it is about stimulating a different kind of economy which means phasing out
1:25:15
destructive fossil based growth oriented production and supporting this small
1:25:25
scale alternatives to to spreads and to scale wide
1:25:31
something that is also referred to in the growth this term instead of scaling up and conquering the world scaling wide
1:25:38
across across the world and uniting in Networks so it is also important to push
1:25:44
for kinds of policies that enable a basic level of well-being which would
1:25:50
also give the kind of freedom and the space to do things differently so such as the universal basic Services which I
1:25:56
think is discussed in a parallel session at this very moment or Universal basic
1:26:01
income green jobs guarantee so some of the ideas that have been mentioned already and of course a third dimension
1:26:08
for uh policy making that is in line with the gross principles would be to
1:26:14
ensure that this well-being and sustainability within Europe is not
1:26:22
brought at the expense of uh of others so hence the canceling of
1:26:28
um deaths and curbing unequal exchange are also key dimensions of a
1:26:35
transformative degrowth-oriented policy making so and I think I will leave it here thank you
1:26:41
[Applause] [Music]
1:26:48
thank you thank you all speakers it has been very
1:26:55
interesting listening to you actually I'm gonna do something that we didn't say I would do but we've been in here
1:27:01
for one and a half hours and we're all living beings with bodies I would
1:27:06
suggest that all that are able to actually stand up a stretch maybe shake a bit
1:27:14
yeah thank you
1:27:25
now you can listen with attention again
1:27:32
I hope is Maya still with us do she we had planned the dance now we
1:27:39
did only the stand up sorry yeah no problem
1:27:46
um is is Maya gonna be on the panel online or is she normally she should
1:27:51
Maya now I see her hi Maya
1:27:58
um right I had a couple of questions that were sent to you in beforehand and I
1:28:05
will keep to those questions but I might not take them into the order that you got them
1:28:12
um I think my first question would you to you would be to ask you what shifts in
1:28:19
cultural or world view do you think need to happen for your vision to come to
1:28:25
fruition so what kind of shifts in world view what are the biggest obstacles that
1:28:31
you're facing with your vision and I'm going to give the floor to Maya
1:28:37
first because she's she can't really wave and take the microphone
1:28:42
no thank you very much um well I think one of the ones that I really
1:28:50
really recognize that we are biological beings and I find it interesting how often we tend to forget this and we're a
1:28:56
embedded in what we call environment as if it was only around us but not part of us and within us quite often in terms of
1:29:04
the air that we breathe water we drink nutrition we take in ETC and to understand that that has a particular
1:29:10
Rhythm so acceleration is not necessarily progress once it's gone beyond that
1:29:15
optimal Rhythm where life can actually regenerate itself so that would be anyone in the world for you to go from
1:29:22
acceleration as an ideal to Rhythm and the second one is to get from parts to partaking to really understand that
1:29:29
we're not isolated from each other and that also naturally you can't just chug out different pieces and put them somewhere else and it will regrow in the
1:29:35
same way but to understand that we are partaking so it's networks and everything that we do will create a
1:29:42
feedback to others and we're going to receive the feedback from that and that this is a way of A System's view in the
1:29:48
world that can help us understand how balancing out and the Regeneration can work but also to understand that we
1:29:55
do have an effect so we are partaking in all of this and we should take voice and that's the
1:30:01
third one that I would like to draw to you which is you have to replace money with value again that was the thing I
1:30:06
was trying to get to that we really understand what our means and what our ends and money is the most fascinating social technology we've brought to life
1:30:13
maybe as human species and it's purely based on contracts it's purely based in
1:30:18
state interventions as last and illness it's purely based on a relationship basically that we've sealed into some
1:30:25
different variations of law so we can really change it and make it that energy for us that can service these three
1:30:32
other points so that we get from extraction to Regeneration
1:30:37
thank you Michael [Applause] [Music]
1:30:44
I'm very skeptical of the argument that we need to change our values
1:30:52
um and that's how we will get to a sustainable well-being focused economy we definitely do
1:30:59
but value change has tended to be slow it's tended to be very very difficult to
1:31:04
direct um we don't really know how it happens I wouldn't trust any NGO or politician to
1:31:11
tell me how you change values what I do know is what is in our control
1:31:17
which is politics and that's how we will actually do things at the speed that we need to do them we've got a decade to
1:31:25
radically shift the nature of our capitalist economy and we will do that
1:31:30
through the behavior of governments it isn't small community renewable projects which are driving the renewable
1:31:36
energy Revolution its capitalist companies deploying vast amounts of global savings under the direction
1:31:43
pretty much now of public policy of public policy by governments who are
1:31:48
elected and they're elected by the public and that is the thing that people need that is the if there's a value
1:31:55
change it's a belief that politically we can change the way in which the
1:32:00
capitalist system works that is the only way we're going to do this in the time available because we're
1:32:06
not going to overthrow capitalism in the next 10 years but we can redirect it and we have already started to do that in
1:32:13
significant ways that's why we have a renewable energy Revolution already they're not doing this the capitalist
1:32:19
company is because they like it because their values have changed they're doing it because it's profitable why is it
1:32:24
profitable because we've changed the Regulatory and pricing systems to require them to do it and they felt they
1:32:30
could make money out of it so the value change if there is one is about is agency is a belief that democracy
1:32:37
politics works that if we work together with our fellow citizens on political
1:32:43
projects whether we do that through parties or we do that through pressure on parties which many of us feel more comfortable with that we can redirect
1:32:51
this system this gross wealth extracting system that we face and that's the value
1:32:58
that I would like to see the thing that the the value that is most corrosive is
1:33:03
at empathy is the belief that we can't change anything and that there isn't any point in doing this and that all we have
1:33:09
to do and and in some people that has been a retreat into all we have to do is to change our own personal values well
1:33:16
yes but get out on the streets as well thank you
1:33:27
yeah so I think I can connect to what Michael kind of finished uh with in the
1:33:32
sense that when we're asked about the World Views there is a typical story that okay but actually people they want
1:33:38
to consume they want all this benefits of a gross Centric economy so but I
1:33:45
think this is really a very wrong presentation of that story so I think that's already when we look at the many
1:33:53
people out there many uh especially in the Young Generation so we see a strive
1:34:00
for something else so and there are many say climate movements environmental
1:34:07
justice movement the various sustainable materialisms movements they are arguing
1:34:12
for the radical change and they already have a different world view out there so
1:34:19
perhaps the world view of the super rich definitely it needs to uh to change and
1:34:25
be challenged so but but I think what I would like also to stress is that sometimes the
1:34:31
kind of um let's say the consumption that many of us are stuck in is very much comes
1:34:38
from a particular menu of Alternatives and there are not enough Alternatives which are sustainable and just at the
1:34:45
same time so I think that it is important to change the world use but it is also very important to
1:34:51
fight for other power relations because this is a particular interests that keep
1:34:57
the growth so Centric in our societies so and in their World Views so they want
1:35:04
their profit to grow so profit is their worldview so in that sense I think that's uh and it is very hard to change
1:35:11
the Corporal a corporate world view to go away from profit so and this is where we need very ambitious transformative
1:35:17
policy making to listen to the voices of the multiple social movements and the
1:35:22
bottom-up Alternatives out there and drive this change thank you
1:35:33
I will ask a question that's not on the paper oh I'm allowed yes um imagine
1:35:40
you three um would be Ursula from The Lion next
1:35:45
week and you can decide on what will happen in Europe in the within the 27 member states on Monday
1:35:55
uh in seven days that will happen you can Implement your growth model in
1:36:01
Europe within seven days and it will be implemented and it will
1:36:06
be there but there's always a but China India and the United States won't
1:36:14
apply the same rules won't apply the same logic what happens then
1:36:23
good question much better to have ones that weren't we didn't prepare for um so
1:36:29
um so we'll need to be careful about this because the US is now pushing more
1:36:34
quickly on the green industrial agenda than Europeans and Europe has got a bit anxious about this partly for defensive
1:36:41
reasons because uh American subsidies which are now huge huge volumes of
1:36:46
subsidies uh which are now going into green technologies uh and green consumption are going to take European
1:36:53
companies away from Europe and into the US and less similar kinds of subsidies can be offered in the EU industria from
1:37:00
the line to her credit has reacted very quickly and we've now got new initiatives trying to uh restore this so
1:37:05
you know if if I were in the position uh of advising Ursula Thunder lion I'd be
1:37:11
saying uh don't do something that America isn't doing do something that America is doing
1:37:16
um and do it in consultation with your trade unions as well as your businesses because we need to make sure that this
1:37:21
is a just transition that we are doing and but invest in the green companies
1:37:29
Technologies and production processes which will decarbonize and which will decolorize Europe and which will uh
1:37:36
create uh new jobs uh particularly in the peripheral parts of Europe and engage in green trade deals with African
1:37:43
countries that want to supply the minerals and to supply the component parts and so on we've already got new
1:37:50
little processes which have begun to emerge called jet Peas Just Energy transition Partnerships with South
1:37:56
Africa with Indonesia with Vietnam and there are others in the pipeline where Western countries including the EU are
1:38:03
trying to do effective investment partnership deals with developing countries to help them get off coal
1:38:10
because it isn't our consumption of fossil fuels which is now driving climate change in Europe it's the
1:38:15
consumption of rapidly growing countries particularly those that invented on coal it is absolutely astonishing that Africa
1:38:21
and Indonesia to coal-based countries are saying we want to stop using coal
1:38:27
but we need help to do it we should be encouraging them providing more investment than we are and doing trade
1:38:33
deals with African countries I've been talking to some African countries who are very keen to engage in green trade
1:38:39
relationships which are not unequal exchange with Europe so I would be saying let's accelerate the process that
1:38:45
the United States has has started of pushing down this green Industrial Road let's do it in a way which provides good
1:38:51
jobs decent jobs well-paid unionized jobs all across Europe and let's
1:38:57
let's offer a vision to European people that this is something that will
1:39:03
generate Prosperity greater well-being greater equality um as well as doing well for the
1:39:09
environment and show them that this is a hopeful future that we can aim for and in doing that get rid of the debt limit
1:39:16
that limits the uh European budgets which the the legacy of maastrich which
1:39:21
is a a ridiculous constraint we need a little bit more Keynesian stimulus that the European system needs to acknowledge
1:39:27
that so we've got some very specific things you should do um but this is where we can provide some
1:39:32
hope not of some idealized utopian future but of something that can make a difference to people's lives now and
1:39:38
I'll tell you what if they go for it they'll get re-elected afterwards
1:39:44
thank you foreign
1:40:15
here again
1:40:21
but first I would like to eat issue my surprise that economists on a panel are
1:40:26
differentiating value from economic metrics measurement pricing Etc because all of that is full of value judgments
1:40:32
and this is exactly
1:40:39
and this is exactly where we have to have a deliberate democracy that makes people understand this it's not
1:40:45
objective neither a Market's objective neither is pricing objective neither is it falling from the skies it's being
1:40:51
done by human decision making and this is why I would really really like for us
1:40:57
to also not go into differentiating the value change from changing all of those metrics and all of
1:41:03
those guiding Frameworks that we've issued and this is where I would go for I would really try to tell a rich and
1:41:09
diversified story of where are we now this is going to be a shocking moment um and then to see how each of the
1:41:15
different interventions is helping us to regrow some of those values that we've differentiated and the well-being ones
1:41:22
were just being mentioned and they are in the treaties the well-being of its people is the article 3 in the treaties
1:41:28
and that includes future people on this continent and so how do we make sure that we have progress indicators that
1:41:34
allowing for us to get out of this fear of everything being lost into a we are rebuilding what we have deprived or
1:41:41
destroyed because we have been blindfolded because we have not had value Expressions clearly on the table
1:41:46
but only monetary indicators that were not letting us see what's happening on the ground
1:41:52
and this is where then obviously you do start and I do think there I'm totally with Michael I think this whole notion
1:41:58
of where do we need to put our emphasis is really to look at how do we get into better relationships with the continents
1:42:04
right next to us and how do we make sure that there we also going into a totally different way of driving those
1:42:10
relationships because migratory patterns is the other ones that are going to be
1:42:15
met or that Europe's going to meet so unless we find a way that our way of
1:42:21
doing uh economy and provide or needing resources but also providing Technologies and getting into
1:42:27
relationships with the neighboring continent is going to be determinant on a lot of other levels that we're not
1:42:32
even talking about when we're talking about security now but we should and this is why I do think that this is
1:42:38
crucial also when we think about the geopolitical shifting when you look at how much China and Russia have been
1:42:43
doing that and have been influential on that content that is something I would really really emphasize right now but be
1:42:49
sure that we do it in a way that makes it a mutual uh beneficial way and get
1:42:55
out of the Superior or the complex that we are the ones that are giving them but understand that we are totally dependent
1:43:00
on them and this is why the notion of how do we find security in the future can only be on really making sure that
1:43:07
we're cutting down as much as we can on the over consumption and the overproduction that we need for people
1:43:13
to live well here and to make the best quality for our industry in terms of
1:43:19
products and services also including benefits as a service so the circularity aspect being crucially important and
1:43:26
doing it in a way that we are looking at other things like a four-day Work Week Etc as well even though right now
1:43:33
obviously the discourse says are you crazy because in Germany we have far to little people right so we're shifting in
1:43:38
this whole oh can we find jobs through the green transformation some things might be broken into oh my God where do
1:43:43
we find people because everything is under a staff so how do we use that moment
1:43:49
and the repair for that being a backlash argument against some of the social benefit
1:43:54
um arguments that we're making here because right now the nurses will come breaking down unless people work even
1:44:00
more so the exploitation not only of nature but of people is totally on the front pages right now as the necessity
1:44:06
in order to stabilize our economy and our ability to compete with China in in the US
1:44:12
I don't know um how exactly you will be able to tell the EU that it is going to
1:44:18
be better necessarily a strong argument in terms
1:44:23
of China and U.S won't overtake us but I think the notion that Europe can overtake China and the US by following
1:44:30
the same model that they're doing is completely naive so it's an open story but the size of
1:44:36
who's talking with whom who's dependent on who right now it's just making that a completely naive
1:44:42
and not very realistic Outlook so instead of going for zero sum competing until the planet's dead and over
1:44:48
exploiting our people it has to be that gutsy moment to say we can show that it can be done differently and then hope
1:44:54
that it will have a very positive effect also under your political pressures because we don't need to depend so much
1:45:01
on other people's territories anymore and they can have more access to what they happen to be living on
1:45:06
we can't promise it's going to work I think that would also be just wrong but it is the only way I think for us to
1:45:13
have a perspective that can actually work thank you very much
1:45:22
fully agree agreeing on that and we have the last intervention of um Ekaterina and we will go to the Q a
1:45:30
for the public yeah so I totally agree with what Maya finished on here so
1:45:36
instead of pursuing this kind of zero-sum game go ahead with it and then
1:45:41
hopefully a larger transformation would follow and go with courage so that's what I would say to Ursula on the line and I would be short here perfect I will
1:45:49
tell her um we make the slido um questioning a second time so please
1:45:57
feel free to do that in order to have perhaps another result than before and it is slightly different
1:46:04
than before Michael you have not convinced at all
1:46:09
foreign but this is not um this was not the aim
1:46:16
of that of that exercise so we will have now q a from the room
1:46:24
um and we will provide um so
1:46:30
there are there was one young lady in the middle of the room so I give you the
1:46:35
floor you push the button to yes to push the button and you ask or perhaps and
1:46:41
you define the person yeah thank you for saying young lady I wasn't sure
1:46:46
um so my my question goes to Michael Michael you're a brave man my name is
1:46:51
Laura Sullivan I'm from we move Europe it's a campaigning organization that works on anything from Deep Sea mining
1:46:57
to migrants to workers rights and and Maya asked the question at the beginning
1:47:04
of why is it that we associate growth with Goods I think one of the reasons is
1:47:09
that very influential people such as yourself continually turn up at 4 like this and give very misleading and
1:47:16
dangerous statements such as GDP has reduced poverty over time now that very
1:47:22
much depends on what you mean by poverty because if you mean the 2.15 dollars per day that the World Bank sets down then
1:47:29
fine granted but anyone I've ever spoken to about poverty who themselves lives in poverty has said that in fact it is the
1:47:36
power and the capability to have some sort of say of your life and in those terms GDP has not changed anything in
1:47:43
fact the only thing that's growing is inequality you did not mention redistribution you did not mention power
1:47:49
I'd like to know your definition of poverty and I really worry about the
1:47:54
idea of rising tide lifting all boats because all those boats are on fire right now
1:48:08
Michael you should and could answer um great
1:48:14
um just just so that people know if you want to know what I think about these
1:48:20
things read some of the stuff I've written because obviously we can't talk a lot about this and I think you'll find
1:48:25
that I'm not where people are kind of assume that I am so let's be very clear
1:48:30
um if you have been living on a couple of dollars a day um you're a Chinese peasant uh 20 years
1:48:38
ago and you're now beginning to enter a a kind of life in which you are now on
1:48:45
25 30 50 a day you're better off and every Chinese person who's been through
1:48:51
that experience would say the same um and if you are a family that lived in a slum in the early 1950s and you now
1:48:59
live in a decent uh house you would say you're better off that doesn't mean that we've abolished poverty because
1:49:04
obviously relative poverty is exactly the things that you say um but really really really really let
1:49:11
us not as comfortable people who can afford to come to a conference like this so we're all comfortable I suspect in
1:49:17
this room tell people who are on low incomes that more income does not
1:49:22
benefit them because it just isn't the case and there are hundreds of millions
1:49:28
of people around the world whose lives have been improved over the last 30 years because they've got more money
1:49:36
now that doesn't mean we've abolished poverty because poverty is always relative so there will always be as long as you've got deep inequalities I care
1:49:42
deeply about inequality you didn't hear me talk about it because you didn't hear I said there are four goals that we need
1:49:49
as Society to get Beyond growth they are environmental sustainability the reduction inequality well-being and
1:49:56
system resilience and I wrote a report for the oecd about that that's why I'm here to Beyond growth panel because I
1:50:03
don't think growth is the objective what I said was there are benefits of GDP
1:50:08
growth and if we simply ignore them then we will not speak to the vast mass of
1:50:15
the public who know that a bit more income is good and we need to be elected
1:50:22
Philip is here as an elected politician the reason he can do anything here is because he's been elected
1:50:30
that's why and unfortunately there are not more people like him because we've not
1:50:35
persuaded people to vote in enough numbers for people who believe with Philippe and I am very close to Philippe
1:50:40
in my in my positions so what I'm saying is let's not because we want an
1:50:46
alternative world and we want a non-capitalist or a church system forget to speak to the people out there
1:50:52
who are voters because they need convincing because otherwise we will not do this we will not do this unless we
1:51:00
have elected politicians in charge of the state making policy which forces those capitalist companies to behave in
1:51:06
ways that they don't want to behave so that if that is my position that is my position I absolutely believe in a
1:51:11
reduction inequality I don't think growth is a useful narrative it doesn't give us what we want but don't think
1:51:18
that there aren't people who we need on our side who don't think a bit more money would be nice
1:51:25
thank you Michael that young lady do
1:51:32
you have to push the button if it doesn't work you have to push the
1:51:37
button next to you then it works no okay no no no no no it works it works oh
1:51:44
maybe I was holding okay so um first of all thank you Mark down closer okay thank you so much for the
1:51:51
presentations by the way I really enjoyed it I'm actually doing my thesis on climate Justice at the moment and I
1:51:57
have a question on actually both sides of the debate in terms of like continuing with GDP and this narrative
1:52:03
on like market-based approaches and also then talking about value because from the critical approaches that there you
1:52:09
there's a lot of talk about value and repositioning ourselves within nature and this is also kind of in line also
1:52:15
with the growth and stuff like this um but a lot of it is a lot of the critical approaches just provide
1:52:20
criticisms and theoretical ideas of what might work whereas with the kind of
1:52:25
capitalism status quo and the we only have 10 years to do this so we have to stay along the same trajectory and try
1:52:31
and work within the Paradigm we're in honestly I did not say we need to stay on the same trajectory or status quo no
1:52:37
I didn't I didn't mean I'm sorry if it came across wrong I guess that from what
1:52:42
I've perceived right that there's we are within a current Paradigm and to shift it to the point where we're looking
1:52:48
Beyond money as a form of value is not super realistic in the time frame we
1:52:54
have so I guess the question I'm asking is is there's like both sides of the argument don't really seem to give me an
1:53:00
answer of like tangible solutions that we can actually apply that go beyond kind of
1:53:06
theoretical assumptions of what might or might work might not work I don't know is that clear or not
1:53:12
um I'm not a professor so I give the floor to
1:53:19
to those who want to reply Michael Katarina Maya
1:53:27
right now Maya okay thank you no I think the the important aspect really is
1:53:34
transparency this is what I was trying to get to in the interventions in order to get the support for changing what is
1:53:42
being put into monetary equations Etc that's the whole notion we've had a long debate about and I've seen some of the
1:53:49
leading figures like Bob Costanza in the room how do we value nature and show how
1:53:54
much it is providing for us without it necessarily commodity pushing for a commodification trajectory and I think
1:54:01
it is the conundrum that we're facing right now because as soon as you start expressing the value of something the
1:54:07
urge for the Surplus Capital that is there it feels so wrong but there's too much money floating around the globe
1:54:13
right now that looks for a financial return on invest and the assets that people depend on are the most secure
1:54:19
rent providing things to own and we have to face the fact and this is where right now we're looking at
1:54:24
biodiversity how can we protect it how can we create revenue for the ones that are actually helping for the soils to
1:54:31
stay healthy helping to regrow what we have as natural value and capital and
1:54:36
then what does that mean for ownership so it has to be a very good way of understanding that we map
1:54:42
especially for rent seeking purposes who does what who earns what and why because
1:54:49
that is the notion of at least if it's going to be a market that is going to govern some of those how markets and
1:54:55
connect all uh work and the whole economic series based on at least some degree of information about the things
1:55:01
that really happen and we've voided that information out of the pricing system to a large degree and at the same time we
1:55:08
do have the problem but unless we're also looking at governance structures like trust funds like Public public
1:55:14
private people Partnerships so not just public private like we've seen that led to the ownership of the fundamental
1:55:19
asset for Universal basic Services there are rents guarantees and we see it that then the public has to print money
1:55:26
in order for poorer people to be supported they go straight in the piggy bank of the ones that are owning this
1:55:31
and this is where the Democratic um contract is broken especially when
1:55:36
the owners sit somewhere else and it is our governments that are having to print the money that they could use for a load
1:55:42
of other things that are more investment and productive rather than propping up the rent seeking of the ones sitting
1:55:48
elsewhere and this is why I think looking at finance and the financial markets and how Finance is driving us
1:55:53
out of the trade-in Solutions between social and environmental goals into fostering a trade-off agenda that's
1:56:00
exactly where it is hard for political political decision makers to hold the
1:56:05
narrative to not have it played out against each other and this is why we have to be so strong on showing what is
1:56:11
hiding behind those numbers and those narratives not only growth productivity value creation
1:56:17
etc etc you have a lot of those guiding once we turn on invest profit that we
1:56:22
should be looking at and say where is money helping and where is it going in the long way because it is the strongest force we have right now especially if
1:56:29
you look at short-termism perfect thank you Maya
1:56:34
short reply from Michael short reply from Michael so we need to be very
1:56:39
careful about the we here but Maya says that she was surprised that I said we don't need to change values or whatever
1:56:45
let's be very clear when Maya says we need to do this she's talking about a a a a relatively small group of economists
1:56:52
business people some politicians who believe in Concepts who know what concepts of productivity of economic
1:56:59
growth are the vast majority of people don't believe those things they value
1:57:04
nature they value well-being they value their friendships and health and so on they don't think like economists and yes
1:57:12
of course we need to change the values of Econo of economics and I would completely agree that I'm not a
1:57:18
mainstream Economist at all but let's not think that because our society is run and our economy is run on the values
1:57:24
of economists and business people that's how the majority of people think at all on the contrary the majority of people are humanitarians and most many of them
1:57:31
now become environmentalists so when I say we are not talking about economists and business people I'm talking about uh
1:57:39
Ordinary People and I think Ordinary People are much closer to where the conference is today uh and so that's
1:57:45
just the distinction between those two ways there is an elite Economist business we need to change completely
1:57:52
all those things that might agree with there's a public we which is much closer to where where this conference is in my
1:57:58
view thank you Michael um last question from the from the room we had now two answers
1:58:05
from two different panelists perhaps a question to a Katarina
1:58:11
yes but we should have a man asking a question because I have now yeah we
1:58:16
should be gender balanced there is a man who will ask a question to a Katarina perfect
1:58:27
oh now you hear me okay um a question I'm an economist I apologize
1:58:34
um no I think economy is is very important it's about redistribution it's about taxation so and on this point on
1:58:43
Taxation and richness we come from a Thai time before the 80s you had
1:58:48
progressive taxation in the United States up to 80 percent is more Taxation and more redistribution
1:58:56
a no-brainer is my question because if you text the riches the most consumptions comes from the I think the
1:59:04
10 richest consume 30 of materials and have
1:59:10
the same percentage of CO2 emissions so it's a more taxation of income more
1:59:16
progressive taxation of income and taxation of uh wealth income especially
1:59:23
is this a no-brainer
1:59:28
so yes all of them are needed uh definitely there should be more taxation
1:59:33
of the reach there should be more taxation much more of the uh
1:59:39
environmentally destructive activities and in the growth kind of spaces we we
1:59:45
discussed for example policies such as maximum income or
1:59:51
the uh yeah kind of Maximum wealth so this is something that is one of the
1:59:58
important ways forward I would say but also maybe apart from mentioning the
2:00:03
taxation which is uh yeah and radical redistribution that's also something that we do need maybe I can also say
2:00:09
that it is important to stop subsidizing a lot of the destructive activity
2:00:15
because this is what happens today with the financial flows which are directed very much it's kind of fostering the
2:00:23
very activity that is perpetuating the climate emergency
2:00:28
biodiversity loss and and other crisis of today
2:00:34
foreign so we have questions that came from
2:00:42
online and due to time we're only going to post two of them but my first the
2:00:47
first question will be posed to you Katrina the growth will require different narratives or what is a good
2:00:53
life how to get this shift attractive to mainstream of societies caught in
2:00:58
consumerism so I think this is something that I partially have addressed so I think that
2:01:03
it is wrong to think that it's really like we're caught in consumerism because I think that often we are not we do not
2:01:10
have the space to make different choices because the choices come from this
2:01:15
consumerist menu and also a problem is that of course we often lack the understanding of how things are produced
2:01:22
and how where they come from but we have now much more of it so I think that consumerism is definitely part of the
2:01:29
problem but there is definitely the productivism that is there so this
2:01:34
Perpetual expansion of production that also then drives consumption and wants
2:01:39
us to consume more wants us to change their phones every every three years makes plant absolutions part of the
2:01:47
design of the uh of the products so I think this kind of productivism also
2:01:52
yeah that is Foster through aggressive advertising so this is something not to be forgotten when we are discussing
2:01:58
consumers because they are part and parcel of the same problem so and when
2:02:04
it comes to the stories of good life without growth so we definitely need
2:02:09
more of those there are many of them already but definitely kind of the idea of let's say sticking to the language of
2:02:16
decoupling so decoupling uh the very idea that of well-being from growth is
2:02:23
still important thank you very much do
2:02:30
the second question we already answered two and I come to the last question of today is the fourth one only about 50 to
2:02:38
20 percent of people think the same way as the idea of the conference
2:02:45
perhaps how are we going to change the actual model and remain Democratic
2:02:51
question to Maya and to Michael to conclude
2:02:56
shortly yeah or do you want to go with Michael
2:03:03
okay [Music] um well I think that it is a lack of transparency that is holding people back
2:03:10
from uh wanting to see the changes and it is linked that I think um Michael that you actually pointed to
2:03:17
were experts and policy makers has a duty to show the steering effects of the
2:03:22
status quo I think one of the biggest challenges right now is to shift the burden of proof onto the status quo
2:03:27
because what we call normality is completely not normal it's the high risk Society globally and as long as we keep
2:03:35
on using indicators that are blind to this people will say we want to maintain this normality but as soon as we are
2:03:42
more openly communicating where the risk zones are and who's is taking what kind
2:03:48
of risk right now and why changing is actually positive in a lot of lot of lot
2:03:55
of areas of well-being there we also don't have to go forward people instinctively say and I think they would also not necessarily need to buy
2:04:02
everything if it wasn't told to them by the market thing messages that are now infiltrating our subconsciousness
2:04:08
through our social media devices so it's very asocial ways of using those possible Technologies right now and if
2:04:15
it wasn't so much ingrained in the way that we talk about success and who's made it I mean the whole disc was there
2:04:21
we're talking about Narrative of who's made it who's a role model who's earned it and who's providing right now again
2:04:28
we have it oh the tech space and is redistribution working or no who is
2:04:33
actually providing and earning and making all of that money that can then be redistributed we have to be there as
2:04:40
well to say and that's the redistribution of a pre-distribution agenda obviously to say why are these
2:04:45
earnings so different between just insectors in the first place that this superiority complex can come around that
2:04:51
the ones that happen to have more negotiating power and thus take home more money are then looked at a
2:04:57
democratic meritocratic way per se without us asking who's doing what who's
2:05:02
earning what and why and this is why it's a democratic process to open up all
2:05:09
of those judgments that are coming as normality that are being replicated in the discourse to allow for participation
2:05:15
in challenging exists including this we always want more stuff I mean when you think about it it's such a desperate way
2:05:22
of looking at yourself you can't ever get in half you're this kind of pavlovian dog everybody that Wheels a
2:05:27
car in front of your face is going to make you run after them come on I mean it's a it's a totally boring story and
2:05:33
also one Economist again sorry um Mr Kahneman who's won a Nobel Prize
2:05:38
for it is so clear that it's not about having a lot of stuff but it's about the experiences connected to it so if we're
2:05:44
much more putting out what we're losing in high quality experiences right now by
2:05:49
being overstuffed with loads of things in the day over consuming over exploiting ourselves because the
2:05:56
productivity after Rise Again health is a very important angle on this one and it's a huge connection between
2:06:01
environmental planetary health and People's Health both in the way that we can reduce the poisoning of our bodies
2:06:08
and by but also reduce the over consuming and change our diets that we have both so it's always about to trade
2:06:14
in narratives I think it's about the transparency of the consequences and the steering effects of the status quo push
2:06:19
the burden of proof on that because then at all you can talk about a fair play of ideas of how you want to move forward
2:06:25
and you can see how we regrow some of the important values and some of the bases for our stability our freedom our
2:06:32
security and our participation the society and economy thank you very much Maya Michael
2:06:41
in Parliament we have speaking time only for one minute so I agree almost entirely with what
2:06:49
Maya has just said um it is the responsibility of economists and people who work in policy
2:06:54
to to debunk all the orthodoxies that I've spent most of my life trying to do that may surprise some of you
2:07:01
um uh on the I don't think this story is I don't think the persuasion of the public is that difficult
2:07:07
the evidence is now there that the model we have the model we've been running for 30 years
2:07:12
um it doesn't work it produces terrible terrible outcomes environmental outcomes but also social outcomes huge
2:07:18
inequalities young people left with almost no hope of doing the basic things that their parents took for granted
2:07:23
getting a home getting a decent job getting a pension and so on the evidence seems to me to be very
2:07:29
clear what we haven't yet got upon most politicians who are able to Marshal that evidence with the experience that people
2:07:36
can see around them so it's not just kind of academic evidence it's the evidence of their own lives with a story
2:07:41
about how if we ditch that model we can still live decent lives and not have
2:07:47
less because that's the fear that's being put that if we get rid of this model we'll be even worse off despite
2:07:54
the evidence of how badly off we are now that seems to me to be about imaginative storytelling by politicians of whom we
2:08:01
have a few here and we need more I think the public is absolutely ready for that and but what we then need them to do
2:08:08
with that is to elect governments that will Implement policies that will constrain this Capital capitalist
2:08:15
behemoth in enough to get us onto a sustainable just path
2:08:21
but that will only be done by governments doing that and that's why we need elected politicians to do this and that's an old story but that is the
2:08:27
story of democracy and we are very very lucky to be still living in a democracy and therefore we can have that hope of
2:08:34
change perfect thank you Michael we come to the conclusion in the first
2:08:40
conclusions will made by Elena yes so
2:08:46
I'm still a bit wondering what my will be in your different Futures also
2:08:53
not only as a human being but as a living being on this planet Earth but I I can pester you after this when
2:09:02
we're eating lunch and try to figure out what my life will be I also want to point back to the story
2:09:07
from 2008 when I was breastfeeding my little daughter and thought that land
2:09:13
was the only thing that would be worth anything in the future there has been times when owning land wasn't the way of
2:09:20
making a living you could make a living from the land without owning it so it could be otherwise
2:09:27
and with that I leave the word to you to end up in this piece yes
2:09:33
um this 1312 so we are over time this
2:09:39
happens sometimes in Parliament first of the things I wanted to say is um I have
2:09:46
the feeling that I learned a lot today um I hope you learned a lot as well
2:09:52
um and the thing I learned is that we have to deal with all of the three
2:09:57
theories in order to um yeah come away and and and Implement
2:10:04
something that could function and that some something that could make the life
2:10:09
of my kids um a good life and this is somehow the conclusion I want to make
2:10:16
um there is no one single way to do there are many ways but there is one
2:10:22
conclusion as well isn't that it's the way that we're actually doing with the GDP growth that we have to quit this way
2:10:29
this is for me essential we have to think about how we do it how we could
2:10:34
have people on our side to do it we have to decide at the end that's true Michael says it several times politicians have
2:10:41
to decide but we have we need people from all over the political
2:10:46
yeah Visions in order to help us to do that and the most the green deal would
2:10:52
never have happened if young people were not in the street on Friday
2:10:58
so this is somehow the conclusion I want to to make and first of all I want to thank the experts here in the panel Maya
2:11:07

2:11:13
