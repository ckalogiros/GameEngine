Beyond Growth plenary 4 â€“ Understanding the biophysical limits to growth


good afternoon good afternoon everyone thank you very
0:15
much for coming back for our final session of today we had a rambustious
0:21
panel uh just before this and I can promise a very exciting panel to end off
0:27
today my name is Fiona Harvey I am the environment editor of the Guardian
0:33
newspaper and I'm here to moderate this panel this afternoon on understanding
0:40
the biophysical limits to growth to build an economy that respects planetary
0:46
boundaries just to give you a few words to begin with on some uh some stuff you may have
0:52
heard before but I'm just going to repeat it for you if you require textual interpretation there's a speech to text
0:58
tool for each of the pleneries it's in 23 languages it's on the website
1:03
interpretation English French German is available on the headsets in your seats and whether you're in the room or
1:10
following the conference online you can participate in the Q a after our panelists have spoken by going to the
1:16
slido link or by scanning the QR code at each entrance it's shown on their
1:21
slideshows and it's also on the conference website so do please participate we want to hear your
1:28
questions or comments when we've heard from our panelists so we're talking about the limits to growth biophysical
1:36
limits to growth because the economy and growth these are human constructs but
1:44
what aren't human constructs of course are the laws of physics chemistry and
1:49
biology and that's what we're coming up against we're coming up against Real planetary limits in our extraction and
1:56
use of resources and if you look at what's happening in the oceans at the moment they're incredibly hot it's off
2:04
the scale according to scientists we've seen unprecedented Heating in the oceans
2:10
what some people fear what some scientists fear is that the oceans are losing their capacity to
2:17
absorb all of the heat that we're pouring into the atmosphere if you look at the Amazon
2:23
many scientists are afraid that what's happening there
2:29
caused by us under as a result of deforestation caused by us that we're
2:34
seeing the the Amazon approach a Tipping Point where it could stop being reinforced start being Savannah
2:40
everywhere around the planet in our oceans in our forests in our
2:45
biodiversity hot spots we are seeing the limits of what we can do as a species
2:51
and we cannot go beyond those limits without doing ourselves irreparable harm so that's what we're here to talk about
2:58
today and I'd just like to remind our panelists teacher of immigrant to speak we've got some who are joining us
3:04
remotely some who are here in person that limits are real
3:09
and you must keep to time uh you've got 10 minutes each to speak uh we don't
3:16
want anyone here overstepping that limit we're going to hear first of all uh from
3:22
the European commission from Valdez dombroskis the Executive Vice President of the commission who's given us over
3:29
recorded message then I'll introduce each of our other panelists and then after that you'll have the chance to ask
3:35
questions okay thank you here's the commission
3:44
thank you for inviting me to speak as a European parliament's Beyond gross conference
3:50
the EU is firmly committed to becoming the first climate natural continent by 2050.
3:56
this ambition is enshrined in the European green deal it aims to transform the EU into a
4:03
resource efficient and more competitive green economy this spans a wide range of policy areas
4:11
including energy agriculture transport and Taxation to mention just a few
4:16
the process of decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions is ongoing since 1990 EU GDP grew by about 50
4:26
percent while carbon emissions fell by more than 25 percent
4:31
but now we really need to turbocharge our efforts the additional private and public
4:37
investment needed for the green transition is estimated at nearly 520
4:42
billion euros per year until 2030. to achieve the green deal goals the
4:49
commission has pledged to mobilize at least 1 trillion Euros in sustainable Investments over this decade
4:56
the current EU budget notably has a climate spending Target of 30 percent
5:01
in the recovery and resilience facility EU countries must dedicate at least 37 percent of financing to support climate
5:08
objectives they are now encouraged to add specific repower EU chapters to their plans
5:14
focusing on Renewables and Energy savings all reforms and Investments financed by
5:21
the recovery and resilience facility must respect to do no significant harm principle for the environment
5:29
also our recent proposals to reform EU fiscal rules recognize the need to achieve a fair green and digital
5:36
transitions they aim to ensure public debt sustainability through realistic fiscal
5:42
adjustment while facilitating Investments and reforms to boost our prosperity
5:48
in particular they allow member states to extend their medium-term fiscal adjustment pass with appropriate reforms
5:55
and Investments here the green deal is of Paramount importance
6:01
this includes member states own work to achieve climate neutrality via National energy and climate plans
6:08
National budgets are also important for the green transition member states must redirect public
6:15
revenue and expenditure towards green priorities and away from harmful subsidies
6:21
this is reflected in the economic governance review it encourages member states to publish
6:26
information on how relevant Tax and Revenue items help meet climate and environmental goals
6:33
the commission has been working with oecd and member states on developing green budgeting practices since 2019 and
6:41
this work is continuing we know that climate related shocks affect fiscal planning
6:47
therefore the review also requires member states to assess implications of climate change and climate related
6:54
policies on public finances I will now turn to private investment
7:01
while Public Finance needs to lead the way the private sector needs to provide
7:06
the scale we need to attract capital from across the board to reach our climate natural
7:12
goals testing in economic activities that mitigate climate change and generate
7:19
economic growth can make a crucial difference Capital markets are essential for
7:24
helping money flow towards sustainable companies and projects we have made it easier for investors to
7:31
do this with the EU taxonomy classification system and we continue to develop it the
7:38
commission will soon propose criteria for water circular economy pollution and biodiversity
7:45
better corporate information is also essential so that Financial Market participants disclose their sustainable
7:51
investment to their clients the commission will soon propose a first set of corporate sustainability
7:57
reporting standards and present a legislative proposal for environmental social and governance ratings
8:05
this helps us to establish standards and labels for sustainable investment products
8:11
for example we house a recent political agreement on the European green Bond regulation
8:17
lastly we help enhance the role played by Green policies in the European semester
8:23
environmental sustainability is now a core element as part of the analysis of
8:28
key social economic challenges in each member state this role will continue guiding member
8:35
states policies through country specific recommendations to conclude the European Union has set
8:43
out a clear Way Forward for fair and sustainable economic growth IT addresses climate change and respects
8:50
planetary boundaries it is now the responsibility of a soul to put this into effect I wish you a
8:57
successful conference thank you
9:04
thank you very much thank you vice president of the commission there that
9:09
was very useful I'm sure you'll agree to hear um and we will move on now to Professor
9:16
Johan rockstrom who's joining us remotely professor rockstrom of course from the Potsdam Institute in Germany
9:23
which is a world renowned Center of climate research uh do we have him
9:31
there we go you've got 10 minutes Johan
9:36
take it away thanks thanks Fiona and a great pleasure
9:41
to be with you I hope you can hear me okay and I should have some slides coming up which I do not see myself at
9:48
the moment but there we are I see them in the in the far back uh would be good
9:55
if I could see them myself as well but let's see how we can we can see you yeah
10:00
there we are thanks so click click the next please so I would argue that scientifically the
10:06
three most important insights that changes the entire economic growth Paradigm for Humanity's future on Earth
10:12
is the inside that we now enter the anthropocene a new geological ebook where we are the dominating force of
10:18
change on planet Earth that the Holocene the last 12 000 years is the only state we know for certain can support
10:24
civilizations As We Know It And The Tipping points are not only real they're coming closer and they can cause abrupt
10:31
irreversible changes of life support systems on Earth this is what leads to the conclusion that we need new growth
10:38
paradigms a development within planetary boundaries that's our chance to the
10:43
Future For Humanity on Earth if you take the next please the anthropocene today is not only a
10:50
geological Epoch we entered in the mid-1950s when we embarked on the great acceleration which is actually where
10:56
economic growth only worked because of or thanks to the subsidies of eroding
11:03
life support systems on Earth causing the hockey stick patterns of rising pressures we are now no longer in the
11:10
anthropocene we're deep into the anthropocene we are starting to hit the ceiling of biophysical processes that
11:16
regulates the functioning stability and resilience of the entire Earth system if
11:21
you take the next this manifests itself today in four crises if you click again the first one
11:28
of course the climate crisis but we're also deep into ecological crisis we are hopefully the tail end of a global
11:35
pandemic which is in itself a reflection of unsustainable exploitation of natural
11:40
habitats it's a stenosis a virus spillover from Wildlife to humans and
11:46
we're also in a geopolitical crisis of instability and a gap or incredible loss
11:52
of trust between countries in the world this is the turbulent manifestation of the anthropocene and in all this we have
11:59
a collision with the stability of to start with the atmosphere if you take the next
12:05
the ipcc sex assessment concludes if you just click once again to give you the
12:11
highlights of the summary report of the AR6 the six assessment report is in my
12:17
mind a breakthrough step forward not only does it conclude that we unequivocally are in the midst of this
12:23
climate crisis in terms of all the extreme impacts we are feeling about it
12:28
today we're also threatening the stability of the planet the health of the planet is at risk and if you see the
12:34
furthest down here is the conclusion that it won't be enough to now only phase out fossil fuels and reach a net
12:41
zero World economy we also need to maintain the resilience in the natural biosphere by keeping at least 30 to 50
12:48
percent of intact nature able to continue to provide resilience this is a
12:54
recognition of planetary boundaries also in the climate science if you take the next the drama is
13:01
increased by the fact that not only are we posing all this pressure we're actually leaving the Holocene at 1.2
13:08
degrees Celsius of warming where we are right now a point that reaches to touch 1.5 degrees Celsius already next year
13:15
when we are to a 66 chance uh approaching a severe El Nino year with
13:23
very high likelihoods of record heat temperatures but if you take the next
13:29
just look at the remarkable stability of the Holocene this is when we leave the
13:34
last ice age 16 000 years ago where hunters and gatherers with a few million people on Earth and we enter the
13:40
extraordinarily stable integration Holocene of 14 degrees Celsius world plus minus 0.5 degrees Celsius and off
13:48
we go in the civilizational journey as we know it today so not only are we threatening the stability on Earth we
13:53
have a reference point for a desired Planet if you take the next this is therefore or the the challenge of
14:01
recognizing what is it that keeps the planet in this stable State well it's not only orbital forcing uh of changes
14:09
in terms of solar radiation on the planet from the sun is also the internal
14:16
biogeophysical processes that regulates the buffering capacity of the earth system and we have proof of this if you
14:22
take the next from the global carbon project we have the hockey stick assessment every year of the global
14:28
carbon cycle you see the emissions above the zero line but we also have this
14:33
remarkable subsidy of the ocean in dark in light green and on land and dark
14:39
green which is the 50 uptake of carbon naturally on a healthy biosphere this is
14:47
when we can keep the system with implanted boundaries the system the Earth system buffers stress and change
14:53
the ocean The graft to the right takes up 91 percent of the heat caused by our
14:58
fossil you're burning this is a manifestation of a planet under stress
15:05
responding in a healthy way by dampening the stress we're unfortunate to seeing
15:11
cracks in this ability does this Fiona refer to in the beginning we're starting to see that for example the Amazon
15:16
rainforest is shifting from sink to Source the world's largest terrestrial
15:22
biome on Earth we're seeing signs of Rapid ice melt abrupt throwing of permafrost changes in
15:30
Ocean heat circulation signs of losing this capacity of keeping the planet
15:35
stable this is particularly a worry because all ipcc scenarios that gives us
15:41
a global carbon budget for delivery on the Paris agreement assume that the planet will remain stable and that there
15:48
are no tipping points the problem is if you take the next that science shows that Tippy points are real and coming
15:54
closer we've mapped this if you take the next the 16 large climate tipping
16:00
element systems that biophysically scientifically have evidence of contributing to regulate the stability
16:06
of the climate system and that they have multiple stable States they have tipping points push them too far and they can
16:12
cross this Tipping Point the Breakthrough here are the color schemes you see this is for the first time we're
16:18
able to assess at what temperature ranges the systems are at risk of crossing their tipping points and if you
16:24
take the next and click one more time please here you have the 1.5 degrees
16:30
Celsius line with the red Embers confidence levels in science for all
16:35
these 16 on the x-axis and the 1.5 degree celsius line shows that four big
16:40
tipping element systems the ones further to the left are likely to cross their tipping points already at 1.5 degrees
16:47
Celsius and we're talking about the West Antarctica sheet the green and ice sheet all the tropical coral reef systems and
16:55
abrupt thawing arboreal permafrost just the two ice sheets host more than 10
17:00
meter sea level rise in the green light sheet in the west Antarctica sheet it would not melt overnight of course but
17:07
it would be irreversible even if it took another thousand years this is why we have so strong scientific evidence today
17:13
for defending and holding on to the 1.5 degrees Celsius planetary boundary and
17:19
you may ask yourself are these a few research groups at the frontier of science pointing this out well yes it's
17:25
published in science recently by one research group but it's now increasingly part of the consensus across the entire
17:32
science Community if you take the next because here you have the equivalent red Embers diagram assessment in the ipcc
17:39
and just click again and you'll find the Black Box in the furthest right which is
17:44
what has happened on the scientific confidence on the risks of Crossing tipping points from the fifth assessment
17:51
and the left column and the six assessment in the right column and you see The Black Arrow showing that the
17:57
more the science advances the more evidence we have of the fragility of your system with temperatures of risk
18:03
going down and now they are in the range of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius for irreversible abrupt events so if you
18:10
take the next there's no doubt in my mind we need to become stewards of the entire planet because in a climate
18:16
crisis you need to keep the resilience of the earth system intact that's why we need if you take the next planetary
18:23
boundaries the heuristic equation is you're welcome to the anthropocene we're
18:28
posing pressures of the planetary level we know the reference of the desired planet to measure against as our
18:34
Benchmark and tipping points are hardwired and real and these planted boundaries have now been researched if
18:40
you take the next for the past 15 years we've identified nine biophysical
18:46
systems that we have scientific evidence that they contribute to regulate the
18:51
stability of resilience of the earth system and these are now I would argue scientifically uh well established the
18:59
challenge is to quantify the safe boundaries and assess the degree of transgression and to understand the
19:06
consequences now I'll show you work in progress and if you take the next this
19:11
is our 2009 first planet to boundary publication we were not able to quantify
19:17
all the nine only six of the nine three of the nine were assessed to be outside of the safe space so it was biodiversity
19:24
climate change and overloading of nitrogen in 2015 if you take the next we
19:30
concluded that four of the nine were outside of the boundary and those that were in the red were deeper in the red we're still moving in the wrong
19:36
direction still not able to quantify all the nine if you take the next this is
19:41
the ongoing 2023 review in review research where we are able for the first
19:47
time to quantify all the nine and unfortunately the conclusion is that six of the nine are outside of the safe
19:53
space we'll continue doing to move in the wrong direction and this is the big
19:58
concern we need to rapidly transform if you take the next we're also applying
20:04
this in different systems this is the food system assessment showing that the food system alone is responsible for a
20:11
large part of the transgression of planetary boundaries and if you take the next just to close on the journey we
20:17
therefore have it's not enough to just phase out fossil fuels in Gray to a netzer world economy we also need even
20:24
for a safe climate Landing to come with implanetary boundaries transforming the food system from source to sink shown in
20:30
brown to orange but also keeping in green and blue the band planetary bound is in the living biosphere intact
20:36
unnaturally ecosystems on land and an ocean this is the only chance for us to to hold on to 1.5 if you take the next
20:44
we have in just a few weeks time the Earth commission will be producing an
20:50
update on this consensus assessment but also add not only safety but also
20:56
Justice and keep an eye on this when when it gets published just in a few
21:01
weeks time in nature and final slide in the next so for this discussion on going
21:06
Beyond growth I think our our kind of mental image must be to put human
21:12
well-being prosperity and Equity hear the sustainable development goals within the safe operating space of a stable and
21:18
resilient planet that that is a new charge for us to have a chance to navigate a future in the anthropocene
21:24
thank you very much
21:35
thank you very much thank you that was a very very clear presentation there I'm going to invite Dan O'Neill now to talk
21:43
to us Dan is professor at the University of Leeds and president of the European Society for ecological economics and
21:51
he's going to talk to us about microeconomics well-being and planetary boundaries
21:57
[Applause]
22:08
thank you Fiona and thank you to the organizers of this this amazing event
22:14
um in fact could we have a round of applause for Leia and Francois who've been working tirelessly behind the
22:19
scenes [Applause]
22:36
so before I start I just want to address one elephant which seems reluctant to to
22:42
leave the room you could call this a housekeeping issue
22:48
in the conclusion to his message Executive Vice President dombrowsky said
22:53
and I quote the European Union is set at a clear Way Forward for fair and
22:59
sustainable economic growth sustainable economic growth that addresses climate
23:05
change and respects planetary boundaries
23:10
let me be clear it is not possible to achieve sustainable economic growth on a finite
23:17
planet [Applause]
23:24
thank you [Applause] [Music]
23:29
and certainly not within planetary boundaries and Professor rockstrom has given us a great overview of planetary
23:36
boundaries of the biophysical limits that the economies must ultimately live within
23:42
and what I would like to discuss with you now is the social implications of living within planetary boundaries and
23:49
the economics needed to make this happen a good starting point is the donut
23:55
developed by Kate rayworth who of course spoke yesterday the donut combines the idea of planetary
24:02
boundaries with the complementary idea of social boundaries it visualizes sustainability as a
24:09
donut-shaped space where resource use is high enough to meet people's basic needs
24:14
this is the social Foundation but not so high that we go crashing through the ecological ceiling of planetary
24:20
boundaries one of the things that my colleagues and I have done is to measure where different countries are in relation to
24:27
this safe and just space here are the results for the European Union
24:32
now I know these slides are a little hard to see so let me try to walk you through this we'll start at the center
24:37
the blue wedges show social performance in relation to thresholds for meeting basic human needs the green wedges show
24:45
resource use relative to planetary boundaries we want the blue wedges to reach the social foundation and we want
24:52
the green wedges to remain below the ecological ceiling anything in red is bad it's either social shortfall or
24:59
ecological overshoot and what you quickly see is that the European Union does quite well on the social indicators
25:05
but it does so by transgressing all six of the ecological boundaries that we were able to measure
25:12
we might contrast this with a country like Kenya which is within the safe space for all of the ecological
25:18
boundaries but it doesn't achieve any of the social indicators associated with meeting basic human needs
25:25
now if we look at a large number of countries together what we quickly see
25:30
is that countries that do well on the social indicators are using resources at
25:35
an unsustainable level so this figure shows the number of social thresholds that each country has achieved in
25:41
comparison to the number of ecological boundaries that it has transgressed and you can see the members of the European
25:47
Union I've highlighted in red they're a little hard to see but they're all pretty much in the top right hand corner
25:53
now the problem is that where we want to be where we need to be is in the top left hand corner where no country
26:00
currently is where this really starts to get interesting though is if we start to
26:06
compare the individual ecological and social indicators so these data show healthy life expectancy in comparison to
26:14
CO2 emissions but I could have picked pretty much any of the indicator pairs almost all of the plots show a
26:20
relationship with diminishing returns so at low levels of resource use a small
26:27
increase improves human well-being quite dramatically but beyond some Turning Point you get
26:33
very little additional benefit and what this suggests is that wealthy countries could dramatically reduce the
26:39
resource use moving to the left in this diagram without hurting human well-being
26:46
now the problem is that European countries are actually moving to the right in this diagram over the past two
26:53
decades we have used more resources not less and despite the message from Executive Vice President dombrowskis at
27:00
the beginning of this session we have not managed to decouple economic activity from its environmental impacts
27:07
[Applause] [Music]
27:12
in fact our modeling work suggests that if we continue with current trends by 2050 as you can see will be even further
27:20
Beyond planetary boundaries and the reason for this is quite simple it is our continued pursuit of economic growth
27:31
we shouldn't be cheering the continued pursuit of economic growth as Albert Einstein once said we cannot
27:38
solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created those problems but as you all know we have
27:45
Alternatives we've been discussing them for the past two days we have ideas like a post-growth or steady state economy
27:51
now Hermann Daly did a lot to develop the idea of a
27:56
steady state economy in the 1970s including his book steady state economics and in the mid 1990s he
28:03
published another book called Beyond growth the economics of sustainable development and sadly Herman passed away
28:09
last year but if he were alive today I think he would be quite happy that we are having a conference name Beyond
28:15
growth named after his book here in the European Parliament
28:21
thank you now my own more modest contribution is a
28:28
book and short film called enough is enough which discusses some of the changes necessary to achieve a steady
28:34
state economy at its simplest this is an economy where resource use is stabilized and kept within ecological limits it's
28:41
an economy where we replace the goal of improving or rather increasing GDP with
28:46
the goal of improving human well-being now as Tim explained this morning if
28:51
resource use is beyond ecological limits if Beyond if it's beyond planetary boundaries then we need a process of
28:58
degrowth in order to achieve a steady state economy degrowth means reducing resource use but doing so in a way that
29:05
protects social outcomes and enables and creates a more Equitable Society
29:10
degrowth in wealthy nations would free up ecological space so that countries in the global South could increase the
29:16
resource use and get people out of poverty okay so this all sounds great but can we
29:23
really do this what do you guys think yes
29:29
one of the first people to really try to explore this was the Canadian Economist Peter Victor he developed a computer
29:35
simulation model for the Canadian economy to explore various low growth scenarios and since this time a number
29:41
of other computer models have been developed to explore the policy changes needed to achieve a post-growth economy
29:47
I clearly don't have time to go through all of these changes but let me give you three examples of the changes that are
29:52
needed the first is to limit inequality growth is often used as an excuse to
30:00
avoid dealing with inequality we're told that a rising tide lifts all boats at least if you happen to have a boat like
30:06
this one as an aside this is Eclipse one of the world's largest super Yachts it has two
30:12
swimming pools two helicopter pads a submarine and its own missile defense system so you know the basics
30:19
and that's good [Applause]
30:25
Henry Wallick who is a former governor of the Federal Reserve in the U.S he once said that growth is a substitute
30:31
for equality of income so long as there is growth there is hope and that makes large income differentials tolerable
30:39
well hold on a second here if growth is a substitute for equality then greater equality is also a
30:46
substitute for growth and a much better choice for the environment and for society
30:51
[Applause]
30:57
in a steady state economy we could limit inequality by having a minimum and a maximum income by a minimum income I
31:04
don't mean some low hourly wage that's conditional on working at McDonald's I mean a universal basic income that every
31:10
person is entitled to regardless of whether they're working or not
31:18
and this could become increasingly important if digitalization and artificial intelligence replace much of
31:24
the work in society that needs to be done another alternative that we've heard about in this conference would be to
31:30
have Universal basic services the ideas are the same we need to provide a social Foundation that ensures
31:36
that everyone's basic needs are met now a maximum income might be more
31:41
controversial particularly if your last name is Bezos and your first name is Jeff
31:48
but it's just as important societies with more inequality tend to have more health and social problems including
31:55
more crime more mental illness and lower life expectancies we need to ensure that the gap between
32:01
the rich and the poor is not too great and we can only do this by having an economic ceiling in addition to the
32:07
social Foundation
32:15
the second thing we need to do and this is my personal favorite at least in theory is
32:21
to reduce working hours [Applause]
32:28
at the moment we large use the benefits of technological progress to produce and consume more stuff what do I mean by
32:34
that well let's say I work in a factory and it takes me eight hours to produce one of these cups
32:40
one day though let's say I come up with a clever idea and I figure out how to make these cups
32:45
twice as quickly does that mean I get to go home at noon well no it means I produce twice as many
32:53
cups and then our marketing department has to go out and try to convince people to buy these extra cups with witty
32:58
slogans like one cup is not enough otherwise I'm out of a job but we can't keep ramping up production
33:05
just to keep people employed remember the planetary boundaries what we can do though is use the
33:11
benefits of technological progress to shorten the working day week and year we can have the same salaries but more
33:16
Leisure Time which certainly sounds good to me thank you the third and final thing
33:23
is we need to change the way we measure progress at present we rely on GDP which we all know is a poor measure of
33:29
progress because it doesn't distinguish between good and bad economic activity
33:34
if the police came to your door and said that activity in your neighborhood had gone up by three percent last year
33:40
you'd want to know what kind of activity was it more children playing in Parks or more break and enters clearly there's a
33:46
difference in a steady state economy we should replace GDP with two sets of accounts measures of human well-being such as
33:54
health happiness employment equality these are the things we want to increase and measures of resource use such as
34:01
material footprint CO2 emissions water use these are the things we want to reduce and keep within planetary
34:06
boundaries now notice I said we should replace GDP not complement it with additional
34:13
indicators
34:20
I can see you're on board the problem is not a lack of good indicators the
34:25
problem is that they're not being used in decision making because they're still trumped by GDP we need to transform
34:31
legislation such as the European stability and growth pact which still gives a lot of power to GDP into a
34:38
sustainability and well-being pact which would set enforceable environmental and social targets
34:46
[Music] and let me just say that a steady state
34:52
economy is not an economy where the goal is zero growth in GDP it is an economy
34:57
where what happens to GDP no longer matters so will any of these changes ever happen
35:04
well I'm an economist not a politician but it's always been my hope that by
35:10
showing that a steady state economy is economically possible that it will become more politically realizable
35:16
at the moment we're making decisions based on whether they're good for growth or good for productivity not whether
35:21
they're good for people or the planet we have forgotten that growth is just one means to an end not an end in itself
35:28
but once we let go of our obsession with GDP we can focus on what really matters the health of our societies and the
35:35
ecosystems that contain them thank you [Applause]
36:01
thank you very much indeed Dan thank you that was great and we can all reduce our
36:06
working hours as well that'll be very helpful um I'm going to turn now to Julia steinbarger who's a professor of
36:14
ecological economics at the University of lausanne who's going to talk to us about some of the policy and political
36:22
aspects of this issue come on then thank you
36:27
thank you all right thanks Fiona thanks to
36:33
everybody for being here um I have a few things I want to get through in my talk but I also have a few
36:40
things to just say from being on the second day of the conference um
36:45
one of the things that struck me is that whenever we hear the policy makers speak we hear about progress
36:52
and we hear about um the fact that they think they're doing good work and I'm sure they are
37:00
within the current setting and when we hear the scientists speak like Johan rashtrum just did like yamina this
37:07
morning we hear a sense of real urgency and danger and I think that the gap between these
37:14
two levels of speech should be concerning to us if we go back
37:25
if we go back to Greta thunberg's analogy of our house is on fire it seems to me like a lot of the policy makers
37:32
we're hearing speak now are sort of patting themselves a bit on the back for acknowledging that we have a house
37:43
good enough okay um on to the talk um so uh I want to talk a bit about
37:49
Democratic provisioning and what I think are some good ideas for sort of how we would move forward a lot faster and a
37:55
lot differently Beyond growth um so and I realize again that nobody
38:01
can see the slides I'm sorry I'm an academic I need them um so the the the the the key idea here
38:07
is that from research that we've been doing at the University of Leeds now the University of lausanne for the past you
38:13
know five six years um there's uh we're really seeing provisioning systems emerge as the key
38:20
linchpin between resource use and planetary boundaries and well-being and social performance on the other so we
38:27
really need to look at what this object of provisioning systems is and study it and change it
38:33
um in terms in in order to to move forward and what does that look like so I wanted to keep things simple uh so we
38:41
have three facts and three ways forward and all we need to do is count to three so off we go um the first fact is inequality and Dan
38:49
spoke about this with the the mega yacht but it's not just you know Jeff Bezos and a mega yacht with missile defense I
38:54
wonder who might be interested in anyway um the the one of the this is these are
38:59
results from Marta balchershevitz um the third paper from her PhD which was taken up by carbon brief and what
39:05
you can see sort of here is that the purple bar that is very equal among income deciles so the top is the top
39:12
income decile the bottom is the bottom income decile in the UK is that housing is fairly equally distributed and the
39:19
categories of energy footprint that are vastly unequally distributed are transport it's cars and flights and so
39:26
we really see not just that energy inequality exists and is massive but we also see where it's being consumed
39:32
that's different rich people over consume they buy big cars they fly a lot and that's basically what they do with
39:39
their extra money and we need to stop that okay
39:45
um so how do we change that so the way forward is sufficiency The Way Forward is this
39:52
social provision and we heard all about sufficiency from yaminas I have this morning I'm not going to repeat her
39:59
definition from the ipcc but I'm going to point out that this picture is an existing place a housing Cooperative in
40:05
Geneva where you don't get to see a single car and it is a beautiful beautiful place and these are the kinds of things that these ideas have shared
40:12
of public for gal a private frugality and public luxury are are feasible and
40:17
desirable and this is a desirable future that we can that we can try to bring forward um the second fact is possibility so
40:25
what I mean by possibility is that a possible future of well-being for all of decent living conditions for all at much
40:31
lower levels of energy use is possible so this is based on narasima Rao's decent living energy framework and when
40:37
we model it we find that you know we can sort of get to decent living energy based on existing Technologies not made
40:42
up ones um with about half of our current energy use but not with a heck of a lot of inequality at all
40:49
um and yarmo kicksters in the audience there you go uh so the way forward here is
40:54
investment so if we want to get to that future one of the things we need to do is investment and this is something
40:59
where I happen to be in agreement with our first Speaker we need massive investment and this is uh something that
41:06
um uh yarmo's paper from 2020 run really shows on the on the
41:12
left hand side on the left hand side you see the investment energy necessary so the investment in technology and
41:19
infrastructure necessary for people to reach this decent living energy um and it's it's it's a lot it's 290
41:26
exit joules roughly which is a good chunk of our annual energy use but this is over a period of decades
41:33
um that we would do this investment and then once you invest in that your energy use afterwards is lower so we really
41:40
have this this sort of uh you know Tipping Point in our economic system basically where we need to invest in a
41:46
future we need to invest in sufficiency not just efficiency sufficiency and a
41:52
lot of that investment is in the global South and a lot of that investment is in the dwelling sector so it's not just about renewable energy it's about making
41:59
our living conditions safe and sufficient
42:05
um the third fact is dependency so provisioning systems could enable good
42:10
lives at low resource use but are in fact often engineered to the contrary to create resource dependency so our
42:18
dependency the dependency on resource intensive consumption is itself an
42:24
industrial product and it is driven by decades if not centuries in some cases
42:29
of lobbying subsidies and state and Regulatory capture so what we have to
42:35
understand is that these provisioning systems could be possibly designed differently but currently are very much
42:40
engineered to create resource dependency and that our governments are very much part of that work and this is a problem
42:46
and here comes my economics lesson based on my artistic skills and I am so
42:52
extremely sorry um so the basic neoclassical Market idea
42:59
is that the market is the flat surface of the sea and we're in Belgium and these ants are carrying buckets of beer
43:07
um and they're basically so everybody is a price taker nobody is a price maker nobody has control over the market neither producers or consumers and
43:14
everybody is delightfully happy drinking Belgian beer um however the reality when we look at
43:19
the political economy at the reality of markets what we see is that it's a
43:25
verdict it's a bunch of vertical Supply chains that are very much tied together so here we have oil roads cars and
43:32
Suburban real estate which is one of the things we studied in our political economy of car dependence and you see these sort of vertical structures really
43:39
tied to each other with the state the state is basically a scaffolding keeping the whole thing up and the consumers
43:46
don't have a heck of a lot of choice so the market ends up being more of a funnel from those over producing sectors
43:52
to creating dependency on their product um
43:57
so in this sense The Way Forward has to be taking power back it has to be taking our governments back
44:04
our budgets back um and I would say that the way forward here is democracy so we have to break to
44:09
break dependency and state capture requires expanding the scope of democracy to our economies right now we have democracies and political system
44:16
that let the market do its own thing sort of and that is extraordinarily dangerous so we need active economic
44:22
citizenship through an expanded decision making at the level of workers community members households and all different
44:29
levels of governance and I think that this you know either we succeed or it's not going to go well for us in fact we
44:35
find that democracy is one of the factors that enables well-being at lower resource use this was a paper by
44:41
yaffeine Fogel who is also somewhere in the audience it's a beautiful paper that the the ipcc also reported on and we
44:49
find that negative factors that make it harder to achieve well-being at low resource use include extractivism so
44:55
dependency on mining and fossil fuel extraction for instance and also economic growth above a moderate income
45:01
so there you have it and that's not because we wanted it to be that way that just fell out of the data
45:06
um in the future uh we are lucky enough to be working as one of the one of the major projects that has been funded in
45:13
this space uh with yoga's uh kallus and with Jason hickle we're going to be looking at this idea of democratizing
45:19
provisioning systems we're going to be looking at post-growth models of resource use and I look forward to
45:25
working with many of you as fast as we can the hour is late but maybe we can still try to move things a bit thank you
45:31
[Applause]
45:45
excellent thank you very much for that and you didn't even hit the limit for times you did brilliantly thank you
45:51
we're going to ask for Hannah Sultana to join us next uh Fran is a professor of
45:58
geography at Syracuse University and is going to give us a perspective on the global South which is oh great there we
46:06
are hello thank you very much
46:11
thank you um everyone for being here and hello to wherever you may be I want to thank
46:18
colleagues at the European Parliament for organizing this brilliant set of sessions and the conference and for
46:24
inviting me to join the panel and I'm honored to join you um albeit from afar
46:29
so I I want to launch into what I want to say in terms of what we know what
46:35
economists have provided us and also provides slightly different analysis here so as has been discussed here in
46:42
elsewhere we know that climate breakdown results from extraction over production and over consumption that are unequally
46:49
and inequitably distributed around the world largely because of historical factors that produce these systems the
46:56
global Crossing of planetary boundaries that Johan talked about however is not
47:02
the same everywhere nor contributed to by everyone as other co-panelists have
47:07
pointed out the unevenness of the outcomes of growth have far-reaching consequences both in terms of who
47:13
benefits where why and how so first of all the capitalists Elite everywhere are
47:20
over consuming and leading the charge you know in their Yachts that Dan showed us they lead the charge to colonize
47:26
Minds into desirable outcome what you should be like what you should aspire to do and as a result that model of hyper
47:35
consumption extractivism and a discard culture throws away everything that we
47:40
actually need to sustain ourselves and the planet these elitists participate and
47:47
accumulation by dispossession resulting not only in disproportionate capitalist benefits from resource control and
47:54
promotion of neocolonialist policies but contribute to ecological harms
47:59
biodiversity crises water pollution air pollution and climate breakdown that
48:05
they don't really experience firsthand every day so the boundaries that are being crossed
48:10
are primarily being led by capitalist Elites everywhere but also entire
48:15
countries of the global North or the high energy industrialized economies causing disproportionate societal and
48:23
ecological harms to more marginalized communities often elsewhere the
48:28
extraction and discard culture embedded in these processes and economic models
48:34
continue not just natural resources exploitation but also the destruction of
48:40
human lives and potentials resulting in a discard for the care economy and
48:46
ecosystem resilience and often just lip service to basic welfare of billions
48:52
caught in exploitative and neocolonial labor relations with global capital and
48:58
extractive resource-based trade that causes irreversible harms the average
49:04
citizens many of you here today primarily in based in or from Global
49:10
North countries and increasingly elsewhere are also all of us are participating in this hyper-consumptive
49:17
lifestyle and are locked into systems of energy use via infrastructure transportation and agricultural modes of
49:24
production that folks often feel are outside of their direct control but as
49:30
Julia has shown us this is clearly not the case we can and do have like
49:35
regulatory changes we need cultural shifts and policy changes and understand
49:40
the wider political economy in order to hold climate Justice Global societal
49:47
equity and sufficiency at the heart of what we can Foster and change and grow
49:52
in order to allow systemic and structural shifts that are indeed very
49:58
much needed so d-linking growth from well-being has been promoted by proponents of d-growth
50:05
particularly confronting the endless growth and extractivism models practiced
50:11
increasingly everywhere but primarily in powerful and rich countries
50:17
this may be challenging to accomplish quickly but they are not impossible it is always a question of intent and
50:24
action and of decision-making power the worlds we inhabit did not just appear
50:29
this is not gravity it was made to happen through particular formations of
50:35
colonialism imperialism and the capitalism of the last few centuries it
50:41
is a destructive fossil fuel-based growth Paradigm the bill for which has been paid historically by ecosystems and
50:49
black and brown communities of the majority world or the global South largely across Asia Africa and Latin
50:56
America many parts of the majority world that were historically colonized and
51:01
exploited the citizens are increasingly being encouraged to Aspire to hyper
51:06
consumption whereby material goods and high energy usage have limited the terms
51:12
of the debate on what well-being can actually be because the pursuit of ever
51:17
higher GDP growth rate has been conditioned to be the only model of prosperity there's obviously no doubt
51:25
that having sufficient water food housing education employment and Health
51:30
Care are critically essential and just yet often impossible or insufficient
51:37
given Global Mal distribution of resource use and power relations
51:42
however with International Development and globalization models and ever
51:48
increasingly media and pop culture and domestic policies around the world being
51:53
influenced by International donors and actors and policy makers more and more countries and communities across the
52:00
global South are being influenced to be aspirational or to mimic the
52:05
unsustainable eurocentric and Western Lifestyles and habits of cultures of
52:11
hyper consumption and Disposal even though it has been established that the current models of capitalist development
52:17
Logics cannot continue unabated at all such ideologies actually often go
52:24
against indigenous and local cultures and practices of sufficiency care
52:30
commoning sustainability and reciprocity which were and continue to be eroded and
52:37
devalued these Colonial capitalist Renditions of modernity that are often spurring on
52:43
high energy desires and pursuit of ever higher and destructive GDP the entire
52:49
model which was in established during colonialism and maintained through Global policies trade Imperial forces
52:57
and so on post-world War II are simply not possible the speed of mitigation actually that's
53:04
needed in the global North is not fast enough to change to keep up with the
53:09
planetary boundary strains so so the rest of the world is facing increasing loss and damages in real time as
53:17
externalities of capitalist growth are increasingly externalized and exported
53:23
to more and more marginal marginalized communities and groups of people at the
53:28
same time by physical resources globally are not always available to everyone
53:33
spatially and societally in Equitable manners to pursue even basic well-being
53:39
the colonization of the atmosphere and planetary Resources by the powerful skew
53:45
what is accessible and available to others the Justice implications are
53:50
naturally extensive and enduring ever since the Industrial Revolution whereby
53:55
the unequal ecological exchange of resources from the majority world to the
54:00
global North resulted in brains of not just resources that are material and economic but also structure the world
54:07
economy that continues to rely on exploitation of resources and peoples for marginalized communities as if that
54:15
is the norm and nothing else is plausible so Scholars have tried to quantify this
54:21
unequal ecological exchange to demonstrate how destructive it is and that we need to imagine other worlds
54:27
they have called it the ongoing Colonial plunder of resources from the global South to the global North one that
54:34
contributes to over developing the latter at the expense of the former such processes continue various Colonial
54:41
patterns of harm and dispossession from the past and into the future with increasing debt burdens to poor
54:48
countries and communities while there is a funneling up of benefits to a few
54:54
these same communities are also the ones at the front lines facing deeper and longer standing climate breakdown and
55:01
are rendered multiply vulnerable as societies extract produce transport
55:08
consume and dispose at greater quantities and at greater speeds it is impossible to expect the system to not
55:15
Buckle or shift in unforeseen ways if the same pathway is pursued the
55:20
challenges to intergenerational Justice must include inter-generational and
55:26
spatial Justice inclusive of accounting of impacts to the global South
55:31
reductions of material and energy throughput is necessary in the global North for climate Justice ecological
55:37
Justice and true decolonization and abolition Justice in the global South
55:43
and increasingly everywhere thus any discussion of moving beyond growth needs
55:49
to reckon more critically with unequal contributions to the crisis as well as how we can discursively and materially
55:56
Foster other Notions of well-being and prosperity Beyond GDP growth and Hyper
56:02
consumption to more practically and equitably encourage alliances and real
56:08
solidarities with social movements across the global south from which lessons can be learned trialled
56:15
unlearned and relearned as feminist decolonial anti-colonial anti-racist and
56:21
anti-imperial Scholars and activists of d-growth post-growth and post-development have demonstrated such
56:29
analyzes must also contend with the intersectional impacts and outcomes as
56:34
well as alternative models of flourishing that exist but are often unheeded or discarded this includes
56:42
attention to intersections of gender arrays class and so on and the ways in
56:47
which the epistemologies and Praxis of well-being and prosper Prosperity occur
56:52
on the ground such concerns need to be accounted for in any discussion of planetary limits and boundaries as it's
57:00
always a question of by whom for whom where and where so in conclusion
57:05
addressing going Beyond growth necessitates real engagement with global
57:10
South indigenous and decolonial scholarship activism and perspectives to be integrated and centered to support
57:17
revolutionary potentialities as possible Pathways forward the crises of climate
57:23
coloniality and unrealistic growth straining planetary boundaries is one of
57:28
lack of democracy in economic organization and planning of institutional policy priorities and
57:34
geopolitical power relations but also one of ontological and epistemological
57:39
shifts at scale oil that include different visions and models that prioritize Futures not based on Colonial
57:47
and Imperial Utopias of endless capitalist growth on a finite Planet but
57:53
one that focuses on restoration reparation caring dignity and
57:58
flourishing for all thank you so much [Applause]

thank you thank you so much for that that was absolutely vital to have that

1:11:37
thank you very much thank you very much aurelian for those very well received remarks excellent thank you now you can
1:11:44
ask your questions or make your comments using the slido application now as I
1:11:51
mentioned at the beginning so uh while you get yourselves together doing that
1:11:56
uh I'm going to ask a little question about panelists here because
1:12:03
um here we are with a lot of support from the greens here not everyone in
1:12:09
Europe or indeed Around The World vote screen and there are many people who
1:12:14
prefer rather populist parties and when you say things like sufficiency
1:12:22
uh they hear rationing when you say limits
1:12:29
they hear limits to my freedom what would you say to that
1:12:36
I'll take care perhaps you'd like to start Julia because you had this idea of sufficiency why is that not rationing
1:12:44
okay thanks Fiona and um it's not my idea I originality is a is not um a
1:12:52
strong suit um so uh I think I'd hate to create uh take credit for
1:12:58
that one I think that um it's one of the things that we've been discussing as well uh during the conference and it and
1:13:04
it's something that also came up this morning in the in the energy panel um I think that in order for these ideas
1:13:10
of sufficiency and limits and really radical change in directions to take root
1:13:15
um I think oral is correct we have to have a change in philosophy um and I but I think that it also has to
1:13:21
do with learning um or exposure something which the guardian actually does from time to time
1:13:27
quite well what the Trap of over consumption it consists of so the idea that over consumption is
1:13:34
freedom when it's really being trapped in a car I mean um I I remember looking at oecd data of
1:13:40
hours in in vehicle driving and the Americans have this we're going up and
1:13:47
the Europeans were going up and the Americans sort of leveled off and the Europeans were still going up and I was wondering why the Americans leveled off
1:13:52
and it's because they were driving as many hours as you can while still needing to sleep and work
1:14:00
they eat in their cars the number of meals eaten in cars in America is huge we don't even anyway so um
1:14:08
so so I think that one one of the things to realize is is that we need to have a
1:14:13
we have a huge communication challenge in terms of exposing over consumption as
1:14:19
lack of Freedom as dependence as lack of safety as precarity as geopolitical risk
1:14:25
and so that's one of the things that we need to do and we need to do it fast but I think that once people understand that
1:14:30
you know you need a car the same way you need to smoke three packs of cigarette a day the things start changing and that
1:14:36
you and that we have the same industrial pressures really that are quite coercive in terms
1:14:42
of pushing that over consumption if people can understand that I think they have quite a different view on this
1:14:47
okay
1:14:53
thank you and something else that that people might ask is um if uh wouldn't there be more to go around if uh if we
1:15:01
had fewer people on the planet Dan wouldn't know
1:15:06
I I thought you were going to ask wouldn't there be more to go around if we limited the incomes of the rich
1:15:12
um I I think this is an issue
1:15:17
which I was about to say yes probably there would be um I think this this issue sometimes
1:15:23
gets dragged out um in in the 1970s population growth was was regarded as quite a serious issue
1:15:31
um to be dealt with but in many ways we we are on the route to stabilizing global population and a lot of analysis
1:15:38
that has been done suggests that over consumption is a bigger problem than
1:15:43
than growth in population and we also have quite a a good sense now in in how
1:15:49
to stabilize global population and it's not by doing a whole bunch of horrible Draconian things it's by doing things
1:15:55
like providing equal rights for women and education and things which we want to do anyways right
1:16:04
so I I would say that that ultimately environmental impact is a product of the
1:16:10
number of people times how much each of those people consumes but at the moment the bigger issue that we're facing is
1:16:17
the issue of of consumption and that's the one we really need to turn our our heads around or our heads towards
1:16:23
because it's the one we're having the bigger difficulty actually addressing I would say
1:16:29
thank you thank you we've got an excellent question here on
1:16:34
slider which is a high can power be taken away from the current ruling
1:16:39
Elites and how peacefully can this be done Aurelia would you like to take that
1:16:45
for us um
1:17:05
presentation
1:17:30
Europe near an Elon Musk is
1:17:37
the problems [Music]
1:17:47
difficile
1:18:04
the society in Revolution Global sunken systems
1:18:21
thank you thank you for that
1:18:27
um I'd like to get this question of uh decolonization in uh as well we're asked
1:18:32
how can the European how can we get the European commission to understand this decolonization issue
1:18:39
um would you like to take that sometime sorry
1:18:44
uh sure so how to get the European commission to decolonize uh is often a
1:18:51
question that is posed by my students how do we decolonize mindsets and
1:18:56
patterns that have created the problem and and I think a lot of it comes from re-education a lot of it comes from the
1:19:03
how we have colonized Minds through education through ideologies through policies so for the European commission
1:19:11
to really take decolonizing seriously first would involve a lot of reading but
1:19:17
also listening you have to listen to communities on the ground in the majority world and Indigenous
1:19:23
communities in subtler colonial contexts in terms of what it means to not just set the terms of the debate you know I
1:19:30
have a seat at a table but to burn the table down reconstruct something different that's what decolonizing means
1:19:36
it doesn't mean diversifying but it really means giving power to different uh bodies and groups to have
1:19:42
decision-making power to have a say to actually do deep listening in order to
1:19:47
kind of uncondition your own mind and that means seeding ground that means seating political power in certain ways
1:19:55
at the global stage and I understand just as it was mentioned before me it is incredibly hard to demand but I think we
1:20:02
can start to see generational shifts but we're at the same time fighting against much greater push from other sectors
1:20:10
whether it's corporations media fossil fuel Industries in who are continuing to
1:20:17
benefit from the kind of colonial capitalist Renditions and and I think we
1:20:22
need to really confront that in a multi-pronged way but a lot of that is basically having a lot of town halls
1:20:28
open meetings a deep listening by those in power and in terms of sharing of
1:20:34
Knowledge from the majority world and from indigenous and black and brown communities and recognizing that there's
1:20:40
not going to be a perfect solution that this is not some easy utopian future
1:20:45
unless you create it to be and and I believe that can only come through democratizing economic policy making and
1:20:52
democratizing knowledge production and knowledge sharing and knowledge consumption
1:20:57
thank you
1:21:04
thank you Andrew and we heard a question about mindsets how do we change people's
1:21:09
mindsets it seems to me that perhaps we might many of us might be living in a Holocene mindset though we've entered
1:21:16
the anthropocene um how would you change mindsets then
1:21:23
I think we're in a very decisive phase right now we're living in um the largest
1:21:30
turbulence on Earth since we left the second world war we are potentially entering a new Cold War and we are deep
1:21:37
deep into the crisis where we are seeing how the Earth system is sending invoices back across the entire world very few
1:21:44
people recognize that ground zero on on changes on Earth today is is in Europe in terms of frequency of forest fires
1:21:52
heat waves droughts and this is changing the mindset I see a shift here where
1:21:58
Global sustainability or sustainability in general even though we are in the early days and is going to slowly is is
1:22:05
now becoming increasingly the entry point for what we mean by welfare or
1:22:10
Prosperity or success and not enough on equity for sure but we are increasingly
1:22:17
seeing that sustainability is Shifting um the whole narrative is shifting from
1:22:22
being and environmental issue about how to what's the willingness to pay for
1:22:28
protecting the environment and how far should we push away humans from protecting and conserving nature which
1:22:35
is the old Paradigm today to being much more an issue of custodianship or
1:22:40
stewardship and even businesses particularly across Europe seeing the
1:22:45
pathway towards better performance and and more attraction of young Talent
1:22:53
being aligning with sustainability so I'm actually this is one of the few
1:22:59
lights in the tunnel that I see how sustainability is changing from from being an environmental crisis issue only
1:23:05
to being a pathway towards a more modern responsible future the challenges has
1:23:11
been very very clear in this panel that we are too slow and we're not shifting the gear fast enough but but I think
1:23:18
that's where we want to move towards a narrative where sustainability is the path towards every responsible
1:23:24
successful and Equitable future I'm
1:23:29
[Applause]
1:23:35
a very good question which is that one of the obstacles to people understanding
1:23:41
this is the lobbying from businesses so how can we stop some of that lobbying who'd like to to take this on this will
1:23:47
be one of our final questions because we're coming to the end of our time Julia um
1:23:53
I think we need researchers and there's tons of them around to take lobbying as
1:23:58
an object of research so I think that this is something that um it's always a bit un you know I don't
1:24:04
know why but it's something that's very much under researched is the workings of power in this way a lot of the lobbying
1:24:10
in this in this space is done in plain sight we have Exxon Mobil that has lobbying
1:24:17
access in the European Union and that has access to parliamentary members and that communicates with them and we have
1:24:23
we have ways of understanding what is said by whom when and exposing it so I
1:24:28
think that a lot of light can be shown can be shown on by research and by
1:24:34
journalists on the workings of lobbying and exposing it so there you know it's true that there's no disinfectant like
1:24:40
sunlight and we need a lot more sunlight on these processes a lot more exposure
1:24:50
thank you excellent thank you very much uh we're nearly at the end of our time I'm going to squeeze in one final question because
1:24:57
I think it's a really good one I'm afraid the commissioner is no longer with us so one of our panelists uh here
1:25:03
who would like to dive for this one it's a great one how can we get the European commission to understand that d-growth
1:25:10
is something different from green growth who'd like to take that on for us here
1:25:21
neutrality
1:25:32
is [Applause]
1:25:56
well that was the final word on that subject thank you thank you all very very much
1:26:03
that's the end of our Channel today
1:26:19
thank you
1:26:33
thank you to our panelists [Music] thank you to the Executive Vice
