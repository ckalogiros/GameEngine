Jason Hickel: Economics in an Age of Climate Breakdown


0:00
I want to begin with with a story maybe
0:02
appropriate for our setting and it's a
0:05
story about it's Easter Island so um
0:09
so of course scholars are still trying
0:10
to figure out why the society on Easter
0:12
Island collapsed putting an end to see
0:15
the people sort of Fame for their
0:17
construction of towering stone heads and
0:20
one very intriguing theory that
0:21
archeologists have is that it had to do
0:24
with the heads themselves okay so
0:27
basically somehow people decided that
0:31
the heads effectively symbolized power
0:33
and success and so different groups on
0:35
the island began to compete with one
0:37
another to build more and more stone
0:39
heads than the other groups there ended
0:42
up being 900 of them some of them 30
0:43
feet tall I mean tower that's was that
0:45
three-story it's almost unbelievable but
0:48
there was a problem that is that there
0:50
was only one quarry on the islands and
0:52
so in order to build this incredible
0:55
amount of heads and moving different
0:57
parts of the periphery of the islands
0:58
they had to figure out a way to cut down
1:01
trees and using those rollers to move
1:03
the stones around the islands okay so
1:05
and so as they as they engaged in
1:08
they're sort of mad head building
1:10
projects in only a few generations they
1:12
managed to inside to entirely DeForest
1:14
this one's verdant island covered in
1:18
tropical forests and if you look at
1:20
pictures of Easter Island today it
1:21
basically looks like scrub lands it
1:23
looks like someone literally mowed the
1:24
lawn around the islands forehead what's
1:26
interesting is that we assume that is
1:28
sort of the natural state of the island
1:30
but in fact it's the clue to the
1:33
collapse itself which is fascinating to
1:34
me so and of course this was it was
1:38
strange because the people must have
1:40
known right that things were not going
1:42
well as they were eating through their
1:44
own ecosystem I mean after a while we
1:47
know that's they didn't have enough wood
1:49
to live in in their traditional houses
1:51
anymore so they had to live in caves we
1:53
know that their diet changed
1:54
dramatically because they used to hunt
1:56
and forage in the forest and suddenly
1:57
those species collapsed we know that
2:00
they were also farmers but because of
2:02
massive deforestation and the collapse
2:04
of floral ecosystems Springs on the
2:06
island themselves began to dry out and
2:08
they could no longer irrigate their
2:09
crops and because there were not enough
2:12
trees
2:13
go around they also couldn't build their
2:14
boats from which they used to fish and
2:16
so slowly slowly they began to die of
2:19
famine effectively and the population
2:22
began to decline really dramatically so
2:25
um and to me what's you know what's
2:27
really powerful about this story is that
2:28
it shows us collapse in rapid motion
2:33
that's all due to effectively admit ok
2:36
but it was a myth that was so powerful
2:37
but despite knowing its madness the
2:40
people couldn't resist it now it's it's
2:43
it might be easy for us to assume that's
2:45
this is maybe a characteristic and sort
2:47
of small scale of societies but in fact
2:49
that's not at all true in our own
2:52
globalized civilization we too are
2:54
subject to very powerful myths and one
2:56
of those myths is very similar to the
2:58
myth that led to the demise of Islands
3:00
so in the same way that Easter Island
3:03
economics was organized on the principle
3:05
of ever increasing stone heads ok so -
3:09
our society is organized or is organized
3:12
around the principle of ever-increasing
3:13
GDP growth so now basically the
3:23
principle is that jeep you must grow and
3:25
must grow at all costs some thing about
3:28
it right so I'm right now GDP growth is
3:30
the primary public policy objective of
3:32
literally every government almost every
3:34
government on the face of the planet
3:35
think about that and it's held by left
3:38
and right alike ok so you know the left
3:41
and the right made bicker about how to
3:43
distribute the yields of growth through
3:44
better wages or public housing whatever
3:46
it might be but on the question of
3:48
growth itself
3:48
they are unanimously united so think
3:51
about the Labour Party up until now you
3:53
know a robust at least a centrally
3:56
robust leftist party has has
3:58
historically been very pro-growth and so
4:00
that on this issue there's no daylight
4:02
between them in the Tories okay this is
4:05
how hegemonic the idea of growth is in
4:07
our society so um
4:11
why must you if you grow the assumption
4:13
that we all have is that GDP growth is
4:15
effectively equivalent to human progress
4:17
this is basically what we're told from
4:19
virtually every media outlet that there
4:21
is concerning the World Bank reports IMF
4:23
reports the world's nations ranks by
4:27
every year every quarter even and so on
4:29
the idea is that we need growth in order
4:31
to do important things that we all love
4:33
like eradicate poverty and improve
4:35
people's well-being create jobs and
4:37
maybe even increase wages we think that
4:39
growth is essential do these things so
4:41
we we take the assumption of necessary
4:43
growth for granted right it seems to us
4:45
to be normal and natural and if you ever
4:48
do stop and question this then people
4:50
look at you like you're completely mad
4:52
yeah and if you don't believe me
4:54
literally try it and see what your
4:56
reaction is it's quite it's quite
4:57
curious it's one of those sort of deeply
4:59
unquestioned assumptions about our world
5:01
so what is GP GP is in sort of very late
5:05
terms it's the measure of all the stuff
5:07
that we extract and produce and consume
5:10
in our economy every year the monetary
5:12
measure of all that stuff so another way
5:15
to put it is it measures the monetary
5:16
value of all the resources that we dig
5:19
up from the earth and the human labor
5:21
that we turn into money so to the extent
5:23
that we churn nature and humans in some
5:26
money that is easy to grow right and
5:30
what's important here is that the
5:32
principle of growth is that every year
5:34
we must extract and produce and consume
5:36
more than we did the year before it's a
5:38
flow measure it's not a stock measure
5:40
and so to grow the economy we have to
5:42
you know next I've got a producing
5:45
consume as much as we are this year plus
5:46
increments okay now what's what's
5:50
interesting about this is that this is a
5:51
relatively recent invention actually it
5:54
was actually the idea of GDP was devised
5:56
only recently by Simon Kuznets an
5:58
American economist who was asked by
6:00
Congress in the 1930s so you figure out
6:02
why the Great Depression was going on
6:04
and how it could be fixed so it came up
6:06
with a measure that that's basically
6:08
added up all of the value in the economy
6:10
every year so they could figure out
6:11
where the problem wasn't and what they
6:12
could do to sort of sort it out and and
6:15
of course the American Congress adopted
6:17
it but in his speech to Congress
6:20
cuz Nets himself gave a warning and he
6:23
said whatever you do never use GDP as a
6:26
measure of normal human progress it will
6:28
be the end of you is what he said and
6:30
the reason is because GDP is an odd
6:32
measure and he designed this a you
6:33
should know it's a measure that that
6:35
that doesn't count
6:36
social negatives or a colossal negatives
6:39
so for example if you cut down a forest
6:40
and sell the forest for timber GDP goes
6:43
up but it doesn't account for the costs
6:45
of losing that forest as a sync Ricardo
6:47
for carbons or as a habitat for
6:50
endangered species or as a future asset
6:52
right and the same goes with saying
6:55
mountains if you slip the mountains for
6:57
coal then GDP goes up but doesn't count
6:59
the cost of the emissions in the cold
7:00
etc etc okay so he warned against it but
7:03
then something happens unfortunately and
7:05
that was that world war two became a
7:07
thing and there were Nazis all around
7:10
and the governments of Britain wanted to
7:13
figure out how they could do people
7:14
Nazis at all costs and so john maynard
7:17
keynes famous British economist rocked
7:20
up on stage and he said well we can use
7:21
GDP okay as a way of figuring out all
7:25
the resources we have available to
7:27
fights the the war efforts okay and
7:30
cousins like wait don't do this it's
7:32
gonna be dangerous you know from my
7:33
warning and he was like no we have to we
7:35
have to beat the Nazis at all costs so
7:36
even though the GDP includes things that
7:39
are bad we need to know how much how
7:43
much monetary power we have so let's do
7:45
that and so it further entrench the idea
7:48
and then most importantly during the
7:50
Cold War in the sort of epic battle
7:52
between the west and the USSR GDP but
7:56
not just GDP GDP growth itself became an
7:58
indicator for measuring which
7:59
civilization was best okay so kind of
8:02
grand pissing match if you will between
8:04
the big men then in this sort of world
8:07
stage and ever since then because of the
8:10
way that globalization has worked this
8:12
measure has been spread around the world
8:14
and now is the dominant feature of
8:16
literally every economic system on the
8:17
planet in a formal sense okay and it's
8:21
no wonder that it's so violent if you
8:22
think about it
8:23
GDP was devised as a wartime measure
8:25
right the idea was a violent intention
8:28
in the first place and so it's not
8:29
surprising that it doesn't pay attention
8:31
to the consequences of violence now
8:34
let's think about what growth means
8:35
again I said that you have to have an
8:38
increment every year to keep the economy
8:39
of close economists say we need about 3
8:41
percent per year so 3 percent maybe
8:43
sounds sort of small to us actually and
8:46
it sounds normal for sure I mean we hear
8:47
this from our politicians almost every
8:49
time they open their mouths this is the
8:51
kind of growth
8:51
we need it's enshrined in the
8:53
sustainable development goals bizarrely
8:54
again it seems easy it seems fine
8:58
because we're used to thinking in a
9:00
linear scale but growth is an
9:02
exponential curve it's a compound
9:03
function so so three percent growth
9:07
means doubling a thing every 20 years
9:11
think about that if you take the global
9:13
economy in the year 2000 which was not a
9:15
time of poverty months I hate right I
9:17
mean right this is time of already rent
9:21
and consumerism in the West and then
9:23
imagine that doubling that global
9:25
economy by the year 2020 and then
9:27
doubling it again from it's already
9:28
doubled states by the year 2040 and then
9:31
doubling it again in the sit-ins and so
9:32
on and so forth right and so the end of
9:34
the century when the global economy is
9:36
32 times larger than it is at the
9:39
beginning of the century that is this
9:40
trajectory that not only we we are
9:42
presently on but trying to advance this
9:46
is our objective which is almost it
9:49
boggles the mind actually if ancient
9:53
Egypt's at the beginning of their
9:54
civilization of the 3,000 year
9:56
civilization had one cubic metre of
9:59
stuff and grew that amount of stuff by
10:02
feet by a modest 3% every year by the
10:04
end of their civilization they wouldn't
10:06
they would have enough stuff to fill 1
10:08
billion solar systems which is in fact
10:10
not a joke this gives you a sense for
10:13
some of the absurd scale effects of
10:15
growth okay now here's the thing is that
10:18
as GDP Rises on an exponential curve the
10:22
ecological impacts Rises right along
10:24
with it and for some of you this may
10:25
seem like common sense okay but I'm
10:29
gonna give you a measure and it's a
10:31
measure of the week that that we and
10:33
ecological economics call material
10:35
footprints and it basically it's a
10:37
single measure that measures all of the
10:38
material stuff that we extract and and
10:41
consume from the earth every year okay
10:43
so everything from petroleum to plastic
10:46
from biomass and forests fish gold and
10:51
silver and stone everything that we
10:53
consume if you add all that stuff up
10:56
then right now we're consuming 80
10:59
billion tons of stuff per year okay for
11:02
perspective the sustainable level of
11:03
material consumptions
11:05
they say I call it just say it's about
11:06
50 billion times tougher year we passed
11:08
that in the year 2000 and we're now
11:10
overshooting that boundary by 60 percent
11:12
per year okay
11:15
and according to the models that we have
11:18
right now with business as usual on our
11:20
present trajectory we're going to hit a
11:22
hundred and eighty billion tons of stuff
11:24
per year more than double what we're
11:25
presently consuming and three times more
11:27
than then the planetary boundary on this
11:30
okay and again this is this is the
11:32
objective this is where we're headed
11:35
so we're living in an age of what we
11:38
call ecological overshoot okay and the
11:42
bed if you're not familiar with that
11:43
sort of the best way to understand it is
11:44
that it means that we're extracting and
11:48
wasting more than the earth can
11:50
regenerate or absorb okay so if we were
11:53
extracting only as much as the earth to
11:55
regenerate the earth is a regenerative
11:57
place and if we were wasting and
11:59
emitting carbon only to the extent of
12:01
the atmosphere could reabsorb it safely
12:02
and our oceans could reabsorb it safely
12:04
we would be at what we call a
12:05
steady-state economy okay but instead of
12:09
being at a setting to say we're in a
12:10
phase of ecologic liver shape and we can
12:13
see the consequences all around us and
12:15
I'm sure that if you read the news
12:17
you're familiar with them okay we know
12:19
that since 1950 half of the world's
12:22
tropical forests have have disappeared
12:24
and believe it or not on our present
12:26
projectory they will be gone by the Year
12:28
2015 which is incredibly soon our
12:32
grandchildren may not see it cut amateur
12:35
topical forest
12:37
fish stocks are collapsing really
12:39
rapidly many of our key fish stocks are
12:42
down to 1% of their former volumes and
12:44
earlier in the 20th century insect
12:47
populations are collapsing this is a
12:48
huge story right now with with key
12:50
insect populations across Western Europe
12:51
down by 75% over only 25 years due
12:55
largely to the chemicals that we use in
12:56
industrial agriculture the broad
12:59
biodiversity extinct extinction rate
13:01
right now the species going extinct at
13:03
more than a thousand time is faster than
13:05
the background rate before the
13:07
Industrial Revolution which some
13:09
ecologist think is actually more serious
13:11
than climate change in terms of an
13:12
existential threat to our civilization
13:14
and then of course there's climate
13:16
change itself which I'm sure everyone is
13:19
aware
13:19
right now even with the Paris agreement
13:21
in place and the nationally determined
13:23
contributions that Nations have promised
13:25
we're headed on the trajectory of three
13:27
of three degrees warming by the end of
13:30
the century which may not sound like
13:32
very much and of course it's will mean
13:34
rising seas but more importantly the
13:36
bigger issue for us is the prospect of
13:39
fennan because as the planet warms then
13:42
agricultural yields began to decline and
13:44
if we're trying to feed a growing human
13:47
population with declining agricultural
13:50
yields this is going to result in even
13:53
according the most conservative
13:54
estimates by by organizations like the
13:57
World Bank mass famine in this century
13:59
which will drive only further human
14:02
displacement and wiped out any gains
14:03
crucially that we hope to make that we
14:05
hope to make against poverty through the
14:08
dominant paradigm of growth okay now
14:12
what's important about this is that in
14:15
terms of responsibility for this crisis
14:17
the hard truth is that virtually all of
14:20
it is due to overconsumption in a
14:23
handful of rich nations like the UK the
14:25
u.s. nations in Western Europe Australia
14:28
and so on okay right now in the average
14:34
high-income nation the average person
14:36
consumes 28 material tons of stuff per
14:40
year okay on average in low-income
14:42
nations of the world the average is
14:44
about 2 tons of stuff per year so
14:46
written rich nations people consume
14:48
about 14 times more material stuff and
14:51
that's a broad category that I just
14:52
discussed before then people do in
14:55
low-income missions okay if we were to
14:57
all-consumed
14:58
at the level of the average person in
15:00
the rest of the world including middle
15:02
in conditions then we'd be consuming
15:04
seven tons of stuff per year which is
15:07
exactly at the planetary boundary okay
15:09
so if we were consuming like everyone
15:11
else in vessel world there would be no
15:12
ecological overshoot in terms of
15:15
emissions maybe but in terms of other
15:16
kinds of ecological overshoot no so this
15:19
this again emphasizes the fact that this
15:20
is down to overconsumption in a few rich
15:23
nations who have been on a grocery
15:24
directory for a very long time and very
15:26
aggressively okay so if the entire world
15:29
were to consume as we do in high-income
15:31
nation
15:32
we would need 3.8 Earth's to sustain our
15:35
consumption which is interesting because
15:38
the plan right now is that everyone
15:42
should be like the West everyone should
15:44
be like high-income Nations this is the
15:45
development objective and of course we
15:47
don't have the Earth's necessary for
15:49
this unless of course
15:50
Elon Musk then just to colonize Mars and
15:52
somehow turn into the earth and then do
15:54
that three or four times more and of
15:57
course what's important about this also
15:58
but this overconsumption has a
16:00
disproportionate impacts on the global
16:02
south
16:02
so just here's one example the global
16:07
south suffers losses due to climate
16:09
change in the region of six hundred
16:11
billion dollars per year which outstrips
16:14
the aid budget by a factor of five okay
16:16
so for every dollar of aid that the
16:19
north gives to the south they lose five
16:21
times more than that simply in cost
16:24
associated with climate change due to
16:26
historical emissions almost entirely by
16:28
rich nations and and this is some of the
16:30
depth of climate injustice each year
16:33
about 400,000 people die due to climate
16:36
change related causes ninety-eight
16:39
percent of those people died in the
16:40
global south every year and the vast
16:43
majority of them are from countries that
16:46
have contributed the very least two
16:48
historical missions of anyone on earth
16:51
so the conclusion here is that rich
16:53
nations need to make dramatic reductions
16:56
in their in their consumption okay in
16:58
the region of seventy five percent
17:00
reductions in material consumption each
17:02
year and emissions reductions of twelve
17:04
percent per year starting in 2015 this
17:07
is our only roadmap to sort of living
17:11
within planetary boundaries but here's
17:14
the question is it possible to achieve
17:16
these kinds of reductions in the context
17:19
of a growing economy this is literally
17:21
the million billion dollar question
17:23
right because remember our objective is
17:27
growth and so how to can objective also
17:31
be this massive reduction in consumption
17:32
right now in 2012 a number of key
17:36
reports came out saying don't worry
17:38
everybody all we need is green growth
17:40
right so we can figure out ways to use
17:44
public policy
17:45
technological innovation to decouple
17:50
material consumption ecological
17:52
degradation from growth so we can keep
17:53
growing our incomes indefinitely well at
17:56
the same time reducing our material
17:57
consumption in our missions back down
17:59
the planetary bodies okay
18:00
this was their promise to us in 2012 not
18:02
long ago of course at the time there was
18:04
no data that this was in fact possible
18:06
but since then fortunately we do have
18:08
data a number of very high profile
18:10
models that have been released that
18:12
explore precisely this question and the
18:14
news time after time after time is bad
18:17
in fact literally every scientific study
18:20
that's been published on this concludes
18:22
the same thing and that is that absolute
18:23
decoupling of resources from GDP is
18:25
impossible including the UN only a
18:28
couple of months ago that came to this
18:31
very strong conclusion that that green
18:33
growth is not a thing so of course we're
18:37
going to need all the technology we can
18:38
get all the best public policy we can
18:40
guess but also it's not going to be
18:42
enough if growth is incompatible with
18:45
planetary boundaries and if then the
18:50
conclusion of course is that some kind
18:51
of deep growth is necessary some kind of
18:53
reduction in our economic activity right
18:56
and this is a difficult pill to swallow
18:58
and almost nobody is talking about this
19:00
fast now we need to we need to sort of
19:02
plan a scale down of our of our of our
19:05
aggregate economic activity in order to
19:07
to maintain the basis for our own
19:10
civilization right now here's the thing
19:14
isn't it crucially whatever I say is if
19:16
someone's always going out there saying
19:17
you're talking about voluntary poverty
19:19
you know hair shirts misery hunger what
19:23
what you know no one's gonna buy into
19:24
this agenda but here's the thing D gross
19:28
does not mean a miseration okay and we
19:31
know that for these reasons in the 1970s
19:34
the United States of America had a lower
19:37
poverty rate and higher real wages than
19:40
it does today despite a GDP per capita
19:42
half of what it is presently right they
19:46
were half as rich in aggregate and yet
19:47
they were doing better in key human
19:49
indicators can anyone guess why that was
19:55
well that okay yeah yeah definitely
20:00
distribution exactly it was a more
20:03
equally a more more equitable
20:05
distribution of the yield to the economy
20:07
already right here's another example
20:09
Europe right has 40% less GDP per capita
20:13
than the US and yet they beat the US on
20:15
virtually every measure of what counts
20:17
education health care life expectancy
20:20
happiness right you know espresso plazas
20:26
etc right Costa Rica Costa Rica has
20:30
better life expectancies in the US and
20:33
higher happiness levels in the US
20:35
rivaling even Scandinavian nations right
20:38
with one fifth of the GDP per capita
20:40
okay because they've invested heavily in
20:43
a universal health care and education
20:45
okay it's easy to generates high levels
20:49
of human happiness and well-being
20:51
without any growth of all simply by
20:52
redistributing more fairly what we
20:54
already have okay so this is crucial
20:58
because growth in fact this idea the
21:01
growth is necessary for us to live good
21:02
lives is in fact a lie we know from data
21:04
after day doctor data but that's not
21:06
true okay so the question is how do we
21:08
get there how do we manage a kind of
21:09
economy where we're scaling down our
21:12
economic activity and the same time
21:13
maintaining and even enhancing human
21:16
flourishing okay so I'm going to appeal
21:20
to your intellect and offer you a couple
21:21
of ideas that we discussed in some
21:23
ecological economic circles now remember
21:27
the goal here is not simply to get
21:29
individuals to reduce their material
21:32
consumption as Noble as editors it's a
21:34
it's a it's a dead end and the reason is
21:37
because we all live in a society in an
21:39
economy that is structurally dependent
21:42
on growth if it does not grow it
21:44
collapses and if it collapses then
21:46
people then people get hurt and they die
21:48
right people lose their jobs they can't
21:50
pay for food on the table they end up
21:53
homeless etc we nobody wants this so we
21:56
need to liberate ourselves somehow not
21:57
just from our own individual
21:58
consumptions but from the tyranny of
22:00
growth that lies at the hearts of our
22:01
economy
22:03
how do we get there we have to think
22:05
first intellectually about why our
22:07
economy has
22:08
grow in the first place once we
22:10
understand why it must grow we can think
22:12
about how to change those features of it
22:13
ok so here's one idea what if we got rid
22:18
of GDP as an objective as a public
22:20
policy objective remember I told I told
22:22
you about the problems with it there are
22:23
alternative measures out there one is
22:25
called the genuine progress indicator
22:26
which starts with GDP and then subtracts
22:30
social and ecological negatives okay so
22:33
when politicians are pursuing GDP I for
22:36
example then they're incentivized to
22:38
maximize social goods while minimizing
22:41
ecological bats okay so when you change
22:43
the thing that we're chasing you change
22:45
the behavior of of our politicians again
22:47
a second idea is to is to do something
22:51
about the shareholder value rules that
22:54
that that corporations operate under
22:57
okay so if you take your average local
23:00
public what is their objective their
23:02
objective is to make enough money every
23:04
year probably the same amount of money
23:05
each year so they can pay their rents
23:08
pay their workers and buy some food for
23:09
their family okay that is their
23:10
objective not to take over every pub in
23:13
the world but literally that is the
23:14
objective just like this idea of endless
23:16
growth of every listed company on the
23:18
stock market and the reason is because
23:19
they have a fiduciary duty to met you
23:21
know by law to maximize shareholder
23:23
returns regardless of the ecological and
23:26
social cost of it but it's very simple
23:29
to change these laws a few sentences
23:31
would do the trick
23:32
so we have people working on this
23:34
already and we should get involved in
23:35
that we've already discussed the
23:39
importance of of a fair distribution of
23:42
the yields of our economy and the reason
23:44
this is important is is because
23:46
politicians tell us that's we need
23:49
growth to improve people's lives and and
23:50
they literally often say themselves that
23:53
growth is a substitute for equality okay
23:57
you would literally hear politicians
23:58
saying this and economists because it's
24:01
easier for them to grow the pie I hope
24:02
that some trickles down then to
24:04
redistribute what we already have more
24:06
fairly but we can take their little
24:08
maxim and turn it around if growth is a
24:11
substitute for equality then equality
24:13
can be a substitute for growth and we
24:15
need to insist on this it used to be
24:17
that demanding greater equality was kind
24:19
of this radical left-wing agenda but in
24:21
fact today
24:22
if it's necessary for a survival on this
24:24
planet or hey this is no longer about
24:26
ideology so in a way we're all
24:29
revolutionaries now where we have to be
24:33
here's another idea
24:34
deep monetizing basic social goods ok
24:37
take the US for example in America
24:41
people spend immense amounts of their
24:42
money on on private health care because
24:44
there's no NHS and on private education
24:47
because as well I mean you'd see but
24:49
there's enormous fees for higher
24:50
education that if those goods were d
24:53
commoditized then they would be able to
24:55
spend a lot less money for the exact
24:57
same quality of life ok allowing them to
24:59
work less earned less and consume less
25:02
without any losses to their well-being
25:04
or take London if the housing stock in
25:07
London was even half deep monetized if
25:09
our rent was half as much we could work
25:11
half as much roughly and earn half as
25:14
much and yet have no loss to our quality
25:16
of life
25:17
think about that this is the kind of
25:19
thing you need to be thinking about as
25:21
we move towards the kind of post growth
25:22
economy I'm going to give you another
25:25
idea and that is a shorter working week
25:29
this is important because of what we
25:31
call the productivity travel in building
25:35
capitalism is the imperative to all for
25:37
corporations to always increase labor
25:39
productivity
25:39
ok as they do so then they need fewer
25:43
workers and so it increases unemployment
25:45
and so politicians have to generate more
25:47
growth to create more jobs to reabsorb
25:49
those unemployed people ok if we had a
25:52
shorter working week and something like
25:53
a job guarantee we could redistribute
25:56
necessary labour so all of us have
25:58
access to incomes we need to survive
26:00
without having to generate more growth
26:02
to create more jobs and reabsorb
26:03
unemployed people ok working less is
26:06
crucial to saving a planet bizarrely
26:09
tell your boss that but here's the last
26:12
idea I have for you I'm sure the hell
26:14
and we'll talk more about this and that
26:16
is that one of the reasons our economy
26:17
has to grow is because of death
26:20
our economy is shot through with deaths
26:22
and because debt comes with interest and
26:25
interest as a compound function all of
26:27
us have to work and produce more and
26:29
more every year simply to pay back our
26:30
debts and so that we can keep sort of
26:34
stability okay so if we had something
26:38
like citizens debt audits deciding which
26:40
debts don't need to be repaid anymore
26:42
because people are rich enough already
26:43
you know which has been done in some in
26:45
some cities and some localities then we
26:48
could rid a lot of our a lot of the debt
26:50
out of our economy okay but but but but
26:53
it wouldn't actually be enough because
26:54
our currency itself is based on debt and
26:57
this is a crucial thing that most people
26:58
don't understand when you go to a bank
27:01
and take out a loan you think that the
27:03
bank is giving you money from this
27:04
it's vault its reserves but in fact it's
27:07
not when you when you get a loan if that
27:09
gives you a loan then it invents that
27:10
money out of thin air literally out of
27:12
thin air and so as it creates money um
27:15
as it gives you a loan it creates new
27:19
money and that money is intrinsically
27:20
dead
27:21
alright ninety seven percent of the
27:22
money is floating around in our economy
27:23
right now his debt in this matter okay
27:26
so which is one reason why we're sort of
27:28
it we have the structural addiction to
27:30
growth so with alternative currency
27:32
systems that are debt free public money
27:35
or positive money it will remove we hope
27:38
some of this sort of growth imperative
27:40
from our economy I'm going to stop but I
27:45
want to say something I want to say one
27:46
last one last thing and that is that I
27:49
really think that we have to be careful
27:51
to not fool ourselves it's easy for us
27:53
to talk about moving towards the post
27:55
growth economy without confronting the
27:58
obvious elephant in the room and that is
28:01
this that is that this kind of economy
28:05
that I'm discussing and the Helen will
28:06
talk about it's fundamentally
28:08
incompatible with capitalism and that's
28:12
difficult for us to contra minds around
28:13
because we're so used to taking
28:14
capitalism for granted right but when
28:16
was the last time we shied away from
28:18
from innovation okay for example I mean
28:21
take smartphones and computers and cars
28:23
when is last time we said this is the
28:25
best smartphone that will ever be
28:26
invented we should never try to improve
28:28
on us okay
28:29
never of course why then do we say this
28:31
the same thing about capitalism that
28:33
somehow this is the best system that
28:34
we'll ever have and we should never try
28:35
to improve this the argument that we
28:37
need to be making is that it's time for
28:38
us to evolve past capitalism to
28:41
something better
28:42
this is not about hair shirts this is
28:44
not about self-imposed limits and
28:45
voluntary poverty
28:47
about a better way of being human a
28:49
better way of living in community a
28:50
better way of interacting with the with
28:52
the intimate other organisms in our
28:54
worlds what we have ahead of us is
28:58
something richer something more intimate
29:00
something more loving and something
29:01
better I mean you're making that
29:02
argument every chance that we guess so
29:07
